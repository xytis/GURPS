#Story of K, the life giver

Born in the slums of Ironfire, Francis spent his youth among pesky criminals
and lowlife scum. From young days he saw the brutality and cruelty of
Ironfire's underworld. At the age of thirteen he joined a local gang. Not much
is worth of mentioning from those years, yet as he struck adolescence a blue
plague outburst hit his closest friends and family. By sheer luck he survived
the sickness, but none of his friends or family did. He succumbed under grief,
but luckily he was found by priest Alpha, who preached new hope into his life.
He started believing in reincarnation and the purpose of death. He preached his
new learned religion among others, and took the holy name of 'K'.
Unfortunately he decided to take the matters of reincarnation quite
straightforwardly. He believed that he can help others to die and reincarnate
in a better life. And so he did. Without saying, a maniacal killer is not a
person that can reside in a large society without someone bothering to stop
him. He was exiled from his gang and from the slums of Ironfire.

Without a purpose, he wandered the country, occasionally relieving unfortunate
souls stuck in their miserable lives. Finally he found himself in the training
camp of Ironfire military, where he believed his preachings would have the
largest effect.
