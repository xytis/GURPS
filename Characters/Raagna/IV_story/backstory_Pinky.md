#Pinky, the traveling Barbarian

...

Days passed while Pinky rode away from his homeland. He had second thoughts
about his decision, yet he was sure that he made the right choice. And during
the solemn hours of travel he decided to keep his past a secret. He will now be
known as Pinky, the traveling Barbarian. It is time he forged a new life for
himself.

...

Several years later, after a number of failings and comical accidents Pinky
finally became somewhat accustomed to the people and their rituals in this
strange land of Ironfire. Also he became accustomed to the thing they call
'gold' or 'coin'. Or more precisely, to the lack of it. But this will change.
Pinky will have a job now. Pinky will join the military and do his thing for
coin. Pinky envisioned happiness and piles of gold in his future as he
approached the gates of Forth Hort.
