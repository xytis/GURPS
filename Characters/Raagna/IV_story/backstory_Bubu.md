#Story of <placeholder>

<placeholder>, bastard of the house Letholdus, lived his life striving for
fathers attention, yet always shadowed by his brothers. His true mother, maid
by the name of Eluned, died when he was too little to remember her face. He was
adopted by an old doctor, who served house Lethodus for generations. Sister
Mary raised <placeholder> to be honest and caring. When he came to year of six,
Sister Mary begged Randalf Letholdus to allow his bastard son to take the same
education as his other offspring. While this decision was frowned upon by Lady
Elinora, Randalf did allow his bastard to learn the art of fighting as well as
the history and heraldry of Ironfire. Unfortunately his brothers always found
ways to mock and undermine his achievements, even when he was more skilled than
his kin. The only person who comforted the boy was the old Sister Mary. During
his teen years he learned basic medicine and was helping Mary to threat wounded
in her little infirmary. When he came of age, it was obvious that
<placeholder> had no place in the noble family of Letholdus. But he was skilled
in fighting and knew a thing or two in diplomacy and politics. Randalf,
pressured by Lady Elinora, contacted Grand Knight Wilhelm and showed the
bastard to the old knight. Sir Wilhelm was reluctant to take an ordinary boy
to the ranks of Blacksteel, but Randalf insisted. <placeholder> was left with
no choice, so with great sorrow he left Sister Mary, and joined the ranks of
Blacksteel Knights.
