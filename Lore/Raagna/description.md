Planet Raagna
=========
### *The land of two suns* ###


Physics
---------

Third planet in this solar system, with an obital period of 512 days.
Slighlty larger than earth, with stronger gravity. (G_Raagna = 1.1G_Earth)
Gravity change can be aclimatized to and completely ignored, unless dealing with
precise calculations.

Su (larger sun) is much larger than Un (lesser star) thus it appears that Un is
orbiting Su, with a perceived period of 32 days. Actual period is slightly shorter.

Planet spins in the same direction as Earth (east is in the east =])

Known solar system, by order:

*   __Su and Un__       stars
*   __Lumos__           little dark servant of the stars.
*   __Tanisi__          shiny colorful planet, similar to Venus in mythology.
*   __Raagna__
*   __Ring of Tilkon__ ring of asteroids, frequently causing meteor showers in
    Raagna.
*   __Bohas__           blue planet, god of open waters.
*   __Hohasat__         red planet, equivalent to hell in mythology. Gates of
    Hohasat are protected by three giants, which came from three visible
    satelites of Hohasat.

Other effects:

Tides are related to suns alingnment relative to Raagna. This means that tides
on Raagna are harsh and powerfull.

Weather changes have monthly micro periods. Temperature is dependant on both suns.
Larger periods dependant on Raanga's orbit form similar seasons as in Earth.

Geography
---------

Currently only one continent is created, so many others may exist.
### Continent of Talmir ###

Created regions:
 * __Bargore tundra__ Lies on Valgart north bank, between Iron mountains and Kagar lake,
home of several human nomad tribes. Ancient 'Ghost gate' is positioned in the middle of
this particular nowhere.
 * __Valgart river valey__ Fertile valey, which is inhabited by orcs and humans. The river starts
high in Iron mountains and flows all the way to the Shardtooth sea. Powerfull strams at the base
of this river with several tributaries bringing waters from nearby valeys makes Valgart nearly
incrossable downstream from lake Kagar. Fort Horth is the last place where one can cross this
river by bridge. River is sailable from Capital of Ironfire, and is (or at least was before the war)
the main route to Shardtooth sea and beond.
 * __Shardtooth sea__ Inland sea which connects to ocean in the east by Strait of Pugrrgar (Splatered Gold)
 * __Grasslands of Graze__ Soft hills lying between two tributaries of Valgart. Perfect place for animal
husbandry.
 * __Bungarth Hills__ splatter of hills near the lake Kagar. Fort Horth -- human stronghold --
is built on one of them.
 * __Hiassing swamps__ misterious and deadly marshland placed south from silver bay, where
Valgart gives its waters to the sea.
 * __Nordic/Freezing wastes__ north of Bargore tundra, where climate becomes arid and cold,
lies unwelcoming wastes, which have brought end to many unwary adventurers.
 * __Death valey__ lush valey in the south, surrounded by mountains in all directions,
with a huge circular ash filled scar of mysterious origin.
 * __The Dark (Kagar) woods__ magical forest just around the lake Kagar (both of which were
named by orcs. Hence 'Dark Lake', 'Dark River', 'Dark Forest', 'Town Near the Dark'. Orcs
are not the most creative species around...)
 * __Moarri Desert__ large sand sea south of Ironfire, behind the mountains of Death valey. Inhabited by goblins, giant worms and other desert creatures. Main trade route to Moarri goes through it.
 * ... consult the map for others ...

This continent spans weather from freezing to rainforests, with high mountains
verticaly aligned near west coast. Shardtooth sea in intercontinental sea similar
to Mediteranian sea. It joins the ocean in the east over some astonishing natural
wonder, which is not yet created. (Proposal for this wonder: Strait of Pugrrgar, something
between a fiord and a strait and an astounding view when the Su and Un rises.)

Cultural specifics
----------

Time calculation is one of the greatest achievements of this era. This era is calculated
from 'The Grand Pact' which settled a common time calculation scheme among humans
and orcs. Currently it is Summer of year 335 of The Grand Pact.

Land is inhabited by creatures that have little or no idea who lived here before
them. And Ancients sure did.
