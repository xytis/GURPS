Bardhof is a town in the middle between Rivermeet and Twinkle, standing on the
western bank of Swaymist river around the inflow of Murken brook. Vast whey
and barley filled valley lay southwest along the Murken brook. North east
across the river of Swaymist dense forests cover hills that raise up into sky
touching mountains. Recently the townsfolk rebuilt the wooden ramparts to
envelop the growing town. Remnants of old wooden wall are still standing in the
inner perimeter here and there.

The townsfolk mostly consist of farmers and fisherman, there are only a handful
of blacksmiths. It is accustomed to brew beer on daily basis in every family.
Two times per year Bardhof becomes a place of festivity, when each household
shows off their best brews, lambs are slaughtered to praise the elder gods for
good harvest and women are showing off their capabilities to carry the most
beer. These festivals draw a lot of attendees from surrounding areas and are
well known across all of Ironfire.

Apart from their beer and festivals this town is completely dull. Orc raids
happen rarely due to the natural protection of Swaymist river. Governors rarely
change and never in the written history there has been a bloody dispute between
Bardhof and the closest neighbours. If we don't count the usual inn fights.

Government in Bardhof is elected every five years. Highest power is given to
representative, he is tasked with maintaining diplomatic conversations with
neighbouring towns, solving disputes in town and appointing members of Great
House.
