# Ironfire

City of Ironfire stands strong between two rivers and a mountain side.

A towering dark keep is carved into a side of a mountain. It is surrounded by a
thick stone wall, which separates the city into two major parts: Haigarden and
Downace. The latter is divided into Manole, Bazaar, Verside and Slums.

Haigarden contains a heavily fortified keep, houses of local noble families,
a large area dedicated to military and Iron Guard, a Theatre and The Great House.
There is only one path to and from Heigarden, via decorated stone gate which
is reachable by a built ramp directly from the Bazaar district. There is a smaller
serpentine crawling up from the northern side.

Downace is surrounded by fortified river bank which has three gates leading
outside from the city. Two of the gates are conjoined with large stone
drawbridges, while Mountain Gate is leading to a narrow passage between a cliff
and a river canyon.

Busy with everyday activity this overcrowded city has plenty to offer. Here
workers are digging deep into the mountains, making various machinery, smithing
items that world has never seen. Merchants are bringing goods from faraway
lands via river and shipping new inventions and machinery away, wealth owned by
merchant families rival royalties from other countries. Poor and underly live
in worst part of the town, sprawling huge messy Slums, thieves, lowlifes and
thugs are rampant there, even the city's protectors, the Iron Guard, are trying
to stay away from that part of town. Center of Bazaar district contains a large
plaza, which has a elegant metal and stone tower, engineered by greatest minds
in all of Ironfire, with a never stopping magimechanical clock, which has three
faces and is visible from all over town. Verside is spread along the southern
river bank, docks and manufactures are occupying most of this district. Most
notable building in Verside is The Sanctuary. Built to honor the Gods of Old it
still attracts the more religious folk for weekly service. After The Great
Agreement no single religion has a leading role in peoples lives. This is
reflected by small churches and shrines scattered throughout the city for
different deities. Manole district touches the mountainside and spreads to
city's center. It is inhabited by old miners and metal workshops. Sound of
clanking metal is always echoing in the stone passageways, solid stone chimneys
are spitting smoke and sparks, heavy carts are towed by oxen to and from the
mines.
