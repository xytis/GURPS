Description
--------------
A town built around the outermost military outpost of state of Ironfire.
Fortified by two perimeters of defensive stone walls. The inner perimeter
houses the military outpost, complete with soldiers barracks, main arsenal,
Maiden of Hope hospital, heavily fortified keep with reinforced walls, mage
district with monolithic obelisk and a library, city governmental buildings,
houses for the upper class and government officials, a few parks, a classy
brothel with a full suite of bath houses nearby, a liquor distillery and store,
tea house and chocolaterie and a few high-profile restaurants. Outer perimeter
contains the engineer district, namely Mallan's workshop, training grounds,
militia armoury and barracks, merchant district with a lively market, craftsmen
district, most residential buildings are found here, several breweries, a
"Skunk's breath" distillery, pharmacy, Rabbit's House of Pleasure (A "classy"
place. Definitely. Mmmyah. Right next to the pharmacy (how fortunate...)), a
few inn's that welcome travellers and offer them rest and sometimes a warm
meal, few pubs and a really bottom-o-the-barrel-grind-your-face-into-the-floor
tavern known as "The Splinter" which offers attractions to the most boisterous
of people. Outer perimeter wall has three gates which guard the entrances and
exits from the city. South gate is known as the "Rivers gate". The road from
this gate leads to a forking which splits into two roads, one of which leads to
the town of Twinkle and the other travels through Blood Fields. The East gate,
known as the "Orc gate" opens a road that leads to the orc controlled
territories. The West gate, known as the "Capital gate", opens the way to
Ironfire. The only gate in the inner perimeter wall is the Knights gate.
