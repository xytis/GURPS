# Apprentice Sword

This sword was owned by Archipelago scholar Ludvic. He enchanted the sword in
late years of his studies. The enchantment was partly successful. On one hand,
the sword was as quick as its wielders mind, on the other hand anyone touching
the sword had terrible hiccups.

# Effect:

 - Hiccups. Effective if holding a weapon or touching it in any way. In case of
   skill check make a roll. On 15 or more you hiccup and get 3 penalty of to
   your current test.
