#Kol'Baraz, Pride of Western Seekers

Crafted in the forges of Allkazar several hundreds year ago this sword was a
gift from the Council of Ethernal Dwarven Reamls to the knight-bishop Imbertus,
the leader of Western Seekers.

Written history reveals that Western Seekers protected High King Lomdumlir
Blackjaw from an assassination attempt. Blacksteels fought of hordes of angry
dwarves, which were rebelling against the Blackjaw clan. It is said that the
final battle in the throne room took three days and three nights. More about
this event can be found in dwarven library of Allkazar.

Kol'Baraz, The Black Oath, is masterfully crafted and imbued with magic to fit
the wielders hand perfectly. The grip is made of finely tanned cave dragon
leather, the blade is forged from black steel, enchantment runes decorate the
fuller. When the sword is wielded runes dimly glow in yellow.

At the time when it was brought to Ironfire it was arguably the finest piece of
craftsmanship in the realm. For all these years this sword is passed by to
knight-bishop of Western Seekers, serving as a reminder of dwarven and human
alliance. The current owner is the renowned knight-bishop Xemon.
