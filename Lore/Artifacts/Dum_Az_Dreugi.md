# Dum'Az-Dreugi, Minds bane

Recently an unforeseen event took place in small village of Varakus. While
building a new house for enriched local merchant, builders uncovered well built
wall. Since the construction was in a way for two stories deep vine cellars,
the merchant ordered wall to be removed. After mason finally managed to break few
finely crafted stones apart, it appeared that it was one of the walls of a
small room.

It seemed that the uncovered room was some sort of storage. There were broken
pieces of amphorae, several metal locks of what appeared to be chests. However,
not only rotten junk was found in the room. Few peaces of jewelry (mostly
rings) and several weapons were also uncovered.

One piece was extremely intriguing. It was a great-axe. The axe looked
primitive even when compared with other items found in the small storage room.
It was made of iron, in places it was chipped and bruised. Also not metal pars
did rot away. It seemed that this axe had been used a lot.

However, it had a strange aura around itself. When holding it, one got a
sensation that his mind was isolated from surroundings - completely his.  This
sensation was so strong and so pleasant, that one found it hard to put the axe
down.

The merchant claimed the axe as well as other findings. He wanted axe to be
restored: handle had to be attached as well as decorations on shaft. Also, if
possible the blade has to be grinded. Since it was time for his next business
trip to Twinkle where he hopped to find an potent smith. His addiction to the
axe was growing by the day, two weeks after uncoverign he could sleep not
holding it.
