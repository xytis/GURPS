# Into the Den

Strong ancient oaks were casting long shadows in the reddish sunset on the
thick vegetation beneath their wide crowns. Birds singing their usual evening
melodies and gushing of a nearby brook filled the atmosphere with serene
calmness.

Rapid footsteps rushed through darkening undergrowth. A thin boy in tattered
clothes ran recklessly with panic in his eyes. His arms were covered in a
mixture of blood and mud. His gaze was racing in front of his feet, desperately
trying to notice bumps and pits in dimming evening light.

A ferocious howl pierced through the forest, sending a chill down the poor
boy's spine. For a brief moment his head turned over his shoulder in fright. A
flock of dark birds took off in the distance. Sound of their flapping wings
reached child's ears just as his foot slid between two roots and halted in
place throwing the boy off balance directly into thorny shrubs. After a moment
of silence shrubs began to rustle. Boy whimpered as sharp thorns dug into his
unprotected skin. He covered his face with one arm and crawled forward. Crimson
streaks appeared on his slender cheeks and forehead when he finally emerged on
the other side. A painful yelp escaped as he rushed back on his feet and
collapsed back on the mush moss. His left foot was covered in fresh blood and
unnaturally twisted to one side. He glanced over his surroundings in
desperation. Fear filled his body like blackening tide as bestial growling came
closer and closer.

A dark gap between two boulders caught child's attention. On all fours he
scrambled and pressed his body against the rock. A glimpse into the darkness
promised a possibly safe hiding place, if only he could squeeze through the
opening. Without further hesitation he put his hands into the gap and prodded
for anything dangerous. Only managing to reach thick darkness boy took his
chances and tried to slide in. His chest painfully brushed across sharp rock
edge as he dived into the dark. Stale darkness engulfed frail falling body.

Boy could not see anything and his mind screamed with thought that he is
falling into a bottomless pit. But in moments notice he landed nose first on
something soft and dry. He turned over and stared at the thin bright gap which
was shining few paces away from his face. A deep growl flew into the opening
from outside. A beast was rustling around. Suddenly a bloodthirsty snot jammed
into the opening and white teeth snapped angrily. Scared child scurried
backwards hitting his head hardly on the stone. As conciousness slipped away
boy saw the dark shadow glooming over reddish sky visible through slim edgy
opening.

...

Sound of rough breathing skid over the rough patch of old leaves and branches
that forces of nature had thrown into the opening between two boulders. A boy
was lying with his head pressed against a dark stone surface. A visible smear
of blood traced down from a spot where his head collided with it previously to
the place where it currently resided. His arms where bruised and scathed, his
left ankle was heavily swollen. Large water drops fell from the young morning
sky and woke the boy from his unconscious sanctuary into the struggle of
reality. Sharp pain blurred his vision as he tried to sit up straight. His
hand touched the wound on the back of his head and felt a fresh scab and bits
of dried blood in his messed up dark hair. Boy murmured an incantation and his
hand started glowing in a pale yellowish tint. Skin on the back of his head
started to swirl like it was made of mercury and reconnected under the dried
blood, a large chunk of now loose gunk of hair and blood fell down revealing a
patch of freshly growing hair. Boy moved his hand down to his ankle. A sharp
crack emanated from under the swollen skin and a painful expression froze on
the boys face. As his concentration wavered glow around his palm disappeared.
After a brief moment he took a deep breath and repeated the incantation with a
more solid voice. After he finished healing his broken ankle and all visible
bruises on the rest of his body he was covered in sweat and breathing heavily.
Obviously magic took a toll on his already fatigued body. Boy got into a more
comfortable position where rain would not reach him and began to recollect his
thoughts. He was hungry. He was dead exhausted. He had no home. He had no family.
As those thoughts surfaced he began to cry. It seems like it was just yesterday
when he was playing tag with his younger brother Kalduk. It felt like just moments
ago he felt the warm embrace of his mother. But then, the fire came. Not an ordinary
fire, but a man amidst a blazing fire storm. Mother ordered him and Kalduk to hide in the
food pit under the kitchen, she pushed the heavy lid atop the hole and through the
chaos murmured "Hide down there and be quiet, my loves".
In the wet and cold darkness two boys sat embracing each other. Kalduk was sobbing
helplessly. ***

"Everything will be fine, little Kalduk, let's just wait until the bad man goes away".

Above the heavy lid heavy screams
were echoing. A sound of wild all consuming flame gushed and bright red light
shone through tiny slits above two boys. Moments later another stronger flaming
gust tore through the old shack they called home. Wooden planks burned like they were
made out of thinnest paper, strong support beams cracked and broke down, together with
large parts of the clay roof, tiles from which were raining down and breaking in the hellish
heat like small glass teardrops. The old house was wailing and shedding tears of pain.
