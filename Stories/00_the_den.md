# Into the Den

Strong ancient oaks were casting long shadows in the reddish sunset on the
thick vegetation beneath their wide crowns. Birds singing their usual evening
melodies and gushing of a nearby brook filled the atmosphere with serene
calmness.

Small hasty footsteps rushed through. Owner of these sounds was a thin boy with
tattered clothes running recklessly through undergrowth. Panic was visible in
his eyes as his bare feet skipped over dark roots. His arms were covered in a
mixture of blood and mud. His gaze was racing in front of his feet, desperately
trying to notice bumps and pits in dimming evening light. A ferocious howl
pierced through the forest, sending a chill down the poor boys spine. For a
brief moment his head turned over his shoulder. A flock of dark birds took off
in the distance. Sound of their flapping wings reached child ears just as his
foot slid between two roots and halted in place throwing the boy off balance
directly into thorny shrubs. After a moment of silence shrubs began to rustle.
Boy whimpered as sharp thorns dug into his unprotected skin. He covered his
face with one arm and crawled forward. Crimson streaks appeared on his slender
cheeks and forehead when he finally emerged on the other side. A painful yelp
escaped as he rushed back on his feet and he collapsed back on the mush moss.
His left leg was covered in fresh blood with foot unnaturally twisted to one
side. He glanced over his surroundings in desperation. Fear was creeping in
back of his mind as bestial growling came closer and closer. A dark gap between
two boulders caught child's attention. On all fours boy scrambled and pressed
his body against the rock. A glimpse into the darkness promised a possibly safe
hiding place, if only he could squeeze through the opening. He put his hands
into the gap and tried to slide in. His chest painfully slid across rough rock
surface and he dived into the dark. For a brief moment boy was floating in
pitch darkness. He could not see anything and his mind screamed with thought
that he is flying into a bottomless pit. But in moments notice he landed on
soft and dry ground. He turned over and stared at the thin bright gap which was
shining few paces away from his face. A deep growl flew into the opening from
outside. A beast was rustling around. Suddenly a bloodthirsty snot jammed into
the opening and white teeth snapped angrily. Scared child scurried backwards
hitting his head hardly to the stone. As conciousness slipped away boy saw the
dark shadow glooming over slim opening.
