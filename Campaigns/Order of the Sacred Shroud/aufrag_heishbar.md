# Backstory

Aufrag is the second son of renowned warlord Gotwalt Heishbar. He was born in
time of weak-minded, following the fall of God Hephaistus in the battlefield in
the far North. His ancestral grandfather has been chosen by God to follow him
into the fateful battle and was struck down among many others while protecting
their God from heathens. The story of that battle is passed among the
generations of Heishbars, urging the offspring to be stronger and more faithful
to the Everlasting Fire than their ancestors.

Aufrag was blessed by a falling star on day of his birth, elders saw this as a
sign that his life must be devoted to bring back Caller of Justice into the
mortal world. He was trained to be strong and agile from the early days. His
devotion is unwavering. He carries the honor of Heishbars along with their
family crest burned into his flesh. At the age of 12 he joined the Order of the
Sacred Shroud and continued to devote himself to the deeds of Hephaistus.

At the age of 18 grim news reached him. His older brother has fallen in battle.
He took the bloodstained helmet from his brothers corpse and woved to avenge
the untimely death of his brother.
