Despite having slight dislike of fire, Mohamed always wanted to follow Hephaistus.
He joined the Orders monastery at the age of 15, where he was prepared for vanguard
duties. 

At the age of 17 he was finished his priesthood training and was ready to be initiated.
However, during the initiation a most bizarre thing happened. One would have to assume
that this had to be Hephaistus will, however, that caused a lot of talks in the order.

Just before the last part of ceremony, Hephaistus granted him the divine powers. And they
manifested by extinguishing every fire in the ceremony hall, including the ethernal fire, that
was burning since the construction of monastery.

This did not sat well with higher ranks in the order.
