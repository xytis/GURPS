# Backstory

Dante grew in the outskirts of Yomi, an important port in Mawerni kingdom. Not much is known about his childhood. One thing that is known is his fascination with old scrolls and magical artefacts.

The same fascination was his downfall. Seeking to obtain an ancient text he overstepped the boundaries of Mawerni society. The only way to survive was to flee. However, he could not find a ship to take him away.

The only way was to use an old family heirloom: a scroll of blood ritual. It was rumoured that this spell would fulfil the casters greatest wish. However, the price was gruesome.

Out of desperation, Dante subdued a late-night traveller and performed the ritual. He wished to appear far away, but instead, a horrible demon appeared in front of Dante. 

The demon offered a deal, he would transport Dante to a faraway place, but at the price of half of his life. Terrified and without any other options, Dante agreed. As demon grabbed him by the hand, the excruciating pain made him faint.

Dante woke up at night, under the unfamiliar sky. His hand was branded with a hellish tattoo. He had a sensation, that the grip of a demon was still there.

Several hard years have passed and Dante managed to familiarise himself with this weird land; a land of people worshipping the dead god of fire.

For the better or the worse, Dante's appearance was similar to one of the locals. Only the slight accent gave away his foreign origin.

Dispising the war, Dante had to find another way of living. In a twist of fate, he got an opportunity to join a monastery.

For several years he practised priesthood, and finally got a rank of an initiate. He was sent to the north; to a city of Corbil in Morton province.

As he reached his destination, he found the city in distress. It appeared that a recent fire devastated several districts. Also, all of Hephaistus priests were murdered night before the fire.

A newly appointed bishop, Emanuel, arrived just a day before Dante. Sadly, Emanuel didn't seem fit for the task at hand. He spent a lot of his day with a bottle of wine.
