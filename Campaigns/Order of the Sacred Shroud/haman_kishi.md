me in Hanam Kanshi and I will resurrect Hephaistus! Ever since I was a boy, I was a small and weak creature, but I have always been fixated at the might Hephaistus posessed. I would tell stories to the other kids about His deeds and strength, some of the kids would just laugh. Nevertheless, I kept my path straight and would often look at fire, seeking truth. Sometimes the fire speaks to me, but I'm not sure if its actually me speaking to myself.

As soon as I got the opportunity, I started going to sanctuarial meetings, where His glory is discussed. After some time, I started getting invites to the preparations for these events. They must realize, that I am somebody important, otherwise they wouldn't want me here. Why else would they want a skinny weakling like me? Having a fast tongue is not enough to prove His might these days.

But I know I am important too. As soon as I got initiated to priesthood, I felt a fiery presence in me, an unordinary one. It is the bond. I feel it. 

Hephaistus knows I am a humble worshiper, that is why he has given me my mission.
