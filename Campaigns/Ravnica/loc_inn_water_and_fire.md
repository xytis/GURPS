# Inn: Water and Fire

A tall elegant building with blue and red banner in the front. Entrance in
behind a small archway. Metal door opens into small room that is crowded with
tables. It is difficult for larger creatures to move through the space between
the chairs. Door in the back leads to kitchen and still. There are no beds for
rent in this inn.

Innkeeper: Large ogre female, with sweet voice. Her name is Jura.

She has a wide variety of strong alcohol and treats everything else as "water".
In the kitchen a goblin, Trizz, is working as a cook. He is also responsible
for all the alcohol that Jura is serving. In the back they have a large still,
which is running almost all the time. Along locals this place is known mostly
for the spirits.

Locals often joke that if Trizz could, he would serve porrage boiled in liquor.

## Example descriptions:

### Nut season

You go through a tall archway and push at a metal door. Hinges squeak and you
enter a well lit room. A strong odour attacks your nostrils, it is sweet with
a strong hint of alcohol and nuts. You see a bar with numerous bottles and vials
behind a hulking figure of an ogre. If not for the few tables in this room, you
could mistake this for an apothecary.

"Welcome, welcome, should I pour or pack?", sweet Jura's voice greets you.

### Medical herbs

Flapping cloth banner above an archway is made from two colors sewn together.
Red part has the word "Fire" and blue part has the word "Water" embroided on them.
They are joined by a black "and" in the middle. Metal door lead into a small room,
where a large figure is cleaning a table. There are batches of dried herbs
hanging around the bar. Air is filled with medical scent presumably from those
herbs.

"Hello there, windy today isn't it?", sweet voice comes from the large figure.
