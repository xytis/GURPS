# NPC Wyn Zumro

Elf, slightly shorter than an average elf, with long black hair, tightly bound
into a bun behind his head. Only few straight strands of hair are falling on
his smooth elvish face. His eyes are showing age, but his composure is firm. He
is a bit naive and welcoming. He is caring for all living and sometimes even
the dead. His major flaw is his love for his niece Neia.

# Setup

A livewood hut, standing on the edge of a well kept Selesnyan forest.
A shelter from the elements for various animals between two large oaks
and a wild garden full of pletora of plants and saplings.
