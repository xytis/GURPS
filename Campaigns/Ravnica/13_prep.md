# Intro

## Waking up

Shinigami opens her eyes in the dark room above Neirius laboratory. There are
no unusual sounds today. Only peaceful breathing of other group members. She
looks around. Wataru is sleeping in the corner, his long inhales are followed
by whistling exhales. His armor is neatly folded next to him. Nai is curled up
in a blanket next to the table. Her backpack has a faint glow from inside.
Katrille has slept next to the shelf full of books. Her emotionles vedalken
face is motionless in the dark. Neirius has a hand hanging out from under his
sheets. He is sleeping in the only bed in the room. His lips are moving, he
seems to be dreaming something. There is no sign on Rozhe. The place where she
slept is empty. Shinigami sits up. Her scythe is next to her. Surprised she
quickly reaches for the shaft. It is warm to the touch. As she lifts the weapon
a faint flicker of hellish flame ignites around her hand. She does not feel
pain. Only warm tingles. Surprised she stares at the dying flames for a
moment.

Door hinges creak in the laboratory below.

## Neirius plans for the future

After drinking morning tea and pastries that Rozhe so thoughtfully brought from
a nearby bakery Neirius will explain his plans.

"You all have been a tremendous help yesterday. I thank you for that. I think I
owe you some clarity on what are we doing. Would you like to hear my theory
about this device?"

"During my research on Guildpact I have stumbled on a mention of ancient and
foreign relic. It was, well, I guess is, if one would ever find one, called
'The Black Lotus'. I could not trace the source of this relic, but it appears
that during the times before Guildpact, when Ravnica was still uncivilized
battlefield, soared by dragons and ferocious beasts and humans, goblins, elves
and vedalken were fighting unending wars, powerful mages wielded the power of
all mana. Contrary to what is common in magic now, mages would tap into all
aspects of mana."

Party members look at each other confused, while Katrille nods in
understanding.

"Ah, I forget that not all of you have had basic magic training. Bear with me
Katrille, I will explain this to others. So as you know there are five core
aspects of mana. We clasify them to memoriable five colors. White, mana of
loyalty and numbers. Blue, mana of ingenuity and mind. Red, mana of emotion
and fire. Green, mana of growth and nature. Black, mana of decay and
corruption."

He takes a deep breath.

"Currently most mages are versed in one aspect of mana. Some, more talented are
versed in two. In exceptionaly rare cases - three. Books that I have read
mentioned even more unique individuals, they wielded four or even all five
aspects. So back in times before time was accounted properly, mages of highest
power were using the Black Lotus as their mana source. In one book, called The
Saga of Zak Dolan, extremely powerful mage used the artifact and
conquered most of Ravnica. The book ended with a mystery. According to it the
mage had dissapeared from Ravnica after he found no more challenge among the
mages of this plane."

Neirius siped his cup.

"Actualy, that book is the last one I found that mentioned Black Lotus. It
would take a great historian to figure out the mystery of the real artifact and
where it has dissapeared. But I am not a historian."

He stands up and goes through a pile of papers on his table.

"Here, I have created a theory about circular mana conducts. Based on my
calculations it is possible to build a self charging mana flow circle. What you
see in the middle of laboratory is implementation of my theory. I call it The
Articifimana Siphon. The task we are now doing is ensuring that the circle
receives proper initial circular charge."

He takes one paper containing two circles drawn out.

"There are many ways to complete the charge sequence, but I have chosen two
that are easiest to balance."

The circles have five colors and five factions written in between.

> green Golgari black Rakdos red Boros white Azorius blue Simic

> red Gruul green Selesnya white Orzhov black Dimir blue Izzet

"Here, these are the two that have the most potential, at least by my
calculations. I would have loved to use the bottom circle, but Dimir guild is
too hard to track, so I started with the top one."

He traces his finger over two guilds. Golgari and Rakdos.

"Our next task should be straighforward. We need to get an audience from angel
Aurelia. Then we need to persuade her, um, Wataru, are angels women?"

"They are not gendered as we think. But they resemble human females. If not for
their wings and strength."

"Mhm. So we need to persuade her to take us and the device into next field
excercise. And it would be perfect if a large number of troops would
participate. Can I entrust you with organising this?"

"Sure, lets talk bussiness."

"Does 50 gold total sound well?"

# Locations

## Church of All Gifts

Three white arcs stand a bit further down the road. Trees and wines surround
the road and cast a warm shadow on the smooth cobblestones. Two large trees
grow and nearly merge with the white arcs. Wines and other plants crawl up the
stone and reemoves the strict boundary between man made structures and nature.
A simple grass opening with stone benches circling a round altas lie behind the
entrance. Large trees cast rays of light through foliage.

Field Sergent Gimbel Otto eyes the party suspiciously as they approach.

"What are these civilians doing with you, cleric?", his voice is rough and
commanding.

...

"I can introduce you to my superior. Angel Sarakiel from Parehelion. But I do not
see why I should."

...

"Today we are going to do a hostile crowd handling excercise. Medics are on
watch for any fatal injuries. We are splitting into three groups. Group A will
be the enforcers, group B will be the radicals, group C will be civilians.
Group A task is to secure the perimeter and withstand the attack. Group B is
tasked to take the flag and carry it back from the middle of the field. Group A
will be penalised for any civilian injuries."

## Selesnya

You see freshly broken tree across the road. You hear loud grunting and
rustling behind thick vegetation.

There are two enraged giant boars fighting for the teritory. A pack of
direwolves stalk them.

## Orzhov

You are able to locate Gregor in his usual spot next to Azorius guard station.
You have wondered what exactly are Gregor's main duties. But you never dared to
ask. He is a sturdy tanned man, with a geometric tattoo on his neck. His hark
hair are short cut, he has a five o'clock beard. His bulky jaw fits his
burrowed eyebrows. He stands as if on guard, his back leaned on the guard
station. He is wearing a long black trench coat. You don't see any weapons on
him.

He acknowledges your presence with a discreet nod.

## Carpet hag

> Characer: Lady Hiu
>
> A small half open tent has number of carpets on display. At the end of the
> tent a small lady is sitting behind a loom. Her side is turned to you, she is
> mumbling something under her nose. Her hands are moving with blurry motion
> across the wires. As you enter the tent she turns her head to you, her hands
> slow down a little but do not stop weaving. Her voice is soft and sweet. She
> talks like a caregiving grandmother.
>
> "What can I do for you, little ones?"
>
> "They call me Lady Hiu. Would like to buy a carpet? I have all sorts of them.
> All hand made."

An old hag is selling carpets in the Tin Street. I've heard her clients have
ended up dead if they threated her poorly and others found gemstones on their
new carpets if they were pleasant.

## Rumble among Gruul

### Rumours

I've heard Gruul marauders of Rukta clan have a new leader, a fierce warrior
named Bren.

Goblin raiders had been seen riding through The Foundry Street. Some say
Gruul became involved with local thugs in The Foundry Street.

Local arms dealer Krenko was found dead after he escaped the Sawtooth prison.

### Traveling tattoo artist

Yargol, an old man with wicked look in his eyes stands on the edge of the
street. He has a small foldable stool in front of him. A sign rests on the
chair: "Tattoos". His upper body is naked, but his skin is covered in a unified
picture of fires, mountains, trees and animals. All forming a shape of a large
panthers head. His left hand has a spining snake on it and his right hand is
blank from the shoulder down. He has a small black leather glove tucked under
his belt. A small satchel lies next to the stool.

He talks in old high pitched voice. He comes from an old clan, which recently
was destroyed by opposing clan in fair duel. Leader had to give his position to
a warrior from Rukta clan. Clan members were given a choice of joining the new
clan or to wander away.

"I, for one, never bowed and never will. I packed my inks and left."

"But you get hungry for meat in these parts. The pitch they give for free
is just an insult. So, you want a tattoo or no?"
