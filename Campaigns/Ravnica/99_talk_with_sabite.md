## Scene: Izzet laboratory

On top of usual madness common to Izzet laboratories, a dread atmosphere
lingered in the chaotic environment.

In the middle of the circular chamber a large device of unknown purpose stood
silent. Side of the cylindrical wall was covered in blood and gore, a large
gear had pieces of bone and flesh stuck in the small gaps between the teeth.
Crystal windows along the remaining wall shown something pulsing inside the
cylinder. Multitude of devices, gauges and levers were attached to the
cylinder.

Surrounding the machine, goblins and some humans are cleaning away pieces of
the poor soul that for some reason was torn apart by the mysterious
contraption.

A vedalken girl was giving away commands from a little pedestal next to a wall
covered in schematics.
