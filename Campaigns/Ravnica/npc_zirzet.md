# NPC: Zirzet

A small muscular goblin with face littered with scars from failed
experiments. Has a really wide network of friends and acquaintances in
Ravnica, mostly due to his charisma and reliability. His main work is
no longer directly involved in experiments, as he say "I g' no free
space on my face for mor'", so he deals in all kinds of tools and
mechanisms, most of which are "borrowed" from legitimate owners under
a wide variety of circumstances. He has good connections with most
guilds and keeps away from deals that would endanger his own hide.
