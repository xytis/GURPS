# Message from Iosif

The cytoplast communicator buzzed in your pouch. It made a soft clinking sound
between the coins. Without anyone noticing you touched the vibrating blob of
transparent artificial flesh. A clear message manifested in your head.

    I am in need of a neutral hand in a few matters. First, may I entrust
    supervision of your risen friend into your acute scientific eyes? Please
    report any abnormalities in his behaviour and appearance if you see any.
    Secondly, I want to know more about the cult that had taken the mind of my
    accomplice. They call themselves "The Gift of Life". I am interested in any
    information you can amass on this topic. I will reward you for it.

Blob stopped moving in your palm and became dormant again.
