# Itch of utmost annoyance

You stand looking at the portal in the wall. It must have taken a full exert on
the Rakdos brain to stick her scythe into the portal. You scratch your neck.
Then you scratch your interdigits. And stroke the length of your trunk. Small
flakes of skin fall free. This itch is getting annoying. Better get a bath.
Soon.
