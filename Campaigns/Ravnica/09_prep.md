You drag your victim into one of the undercity passageways. Slightly mossy path
opens up into a cavern, made from old shrine with crumbled dome roof. Streaks
of daylight illuminate bright patches of stone floor, leaving corners of the
room in impenetrable darkness. There are three exits out of this underground
building, Nai came here before through the one directly in front before. Dirt
and piles of rock lie on the edges of the cavern-like-room. Windows have
shattered eons ago, leaving only rough stone and brick visible through them,

One of the dorways lead to a nest of gricks, which has piles of bones lying
around. Scavenging through the bone piles you may find:

# Hooks, secrets and rumours

(7th of Mokosh)

Banners announcing festival in the Gore House on 9th of Mokosh are everywhere.
Red cloth with dark strokes and a painting of current Blood Witch Exava
caressing a demon skull. Banner reads "Unleash your bodily desires! Enjoy the
thrill of love and pain!". Some of the banners have a warning from Azorius that
festivity including succubi and incubi is breaking the law as of 10th of
Mokosh. To which some of Azorius banners are violated with insulting remarks or
undignifying paintings.

Black cloth banners with symbolism of Orzhov announce fighting competition
which takes place through all Mokosh. Next match is on 8th Mokosh at the
Oathkeeper Emporium. Tickets are starting from 5 zibs.

Today people are talking about riot and clenching of it near Seventh Zonot.
There are rumours that a water dragon came flying over the city and drenching
the crowd in water. There is also a rumour that a cult is planning to
release all Simic creatures into the wild where they belong.
