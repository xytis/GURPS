--"Seventeen you say? Oh dear. That is most disconcerning. I may know only of
one vedalken who has a number on his hand. He is my, um, was a part of biomana
enhancement project. It was a success and his magic abilities had been
enhanced. He then became my associate and we worked for more than an decade
together. But something had gotten into him lately, and he started a movement
against Simic enhancements. I never thought he would be this ridiculous, to
come in to my laboratory and release all the creatures we worked on together."

Iosif turned to his pile of papers and took the top one.

--"He handed me this last time we met. I thought it was some sort of a joke,
but given his actions, I am afraid he lost his mind."

He hands over a leaflet, which shames the Simic biomancy and warns of godless
creations, which will rise and attack the living.

--"Here is your potion",- biochemist points to a golden concoctioin on his
working table, -"I will need your assistance soon to wrap up this business with
my former associate. I will reach you with this."- Iosif hands Katrille a small
cytoplast sphere. -"Remember to apply the potion to the freshly deceased. It
will not work as expected to anything that died of natural causes or died more
than ten days ago."
