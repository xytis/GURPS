# Recap

As you took a little break from the magical research with Neirius, you took on a
public contract signed by Tamid Luade. A task appeared to be simple: you had to
find evidence against Linda Moisuz and escalate the case to the Chamber of the
Guildpact. However, things were not as trivial as they appeared. You
interrogated Linda, who claimed she was innocent and begged for your help. You
met with Mortimer Lan, who gave you a lucrative offer to clean out the mess
Linda's creatures have caused to Golgari, thus helping to gloss out this inter
guild feud and get Linda (and himself) out of the trouble. After you were
finished with necro-pest control, you were ambushed and the party was split.
You spent the night trying to find each other in the Ravnica's undercity, to no
success. Only by dawn, you grouped back together in Neirius Lab. Meanwhile,
Linda disappeared from the holding cell she was in. And half of you were blamed
for it. You even got your portraits printed on the second page of "Ravnica's
Daybreak" (a local newspaper).

You began suspecting that this was all a large scheme by Tamid Luade.

Mortimer was unable to give much assistance regarding the inner workings of the
Azorius Guild (and was reluctant to call in any favours). Rozhe's uncle Eroan
listened to your story and promised to talk with his superiors if you can bring
tangible evidence regarding Mr Luade.

To do that, you set up a trap in one of the Simic rental labs. Your goal was to
capture Tamid and interrogate him. However, things turned out differently.
Tamid nearly died and managed to escape. Your only trail is an injured vampire
that fled towards the docks. Nai suspected that he returned to the warehouse
she discovered earlier.


# Intro

You rush the alleys of Ravnica. Nai is leading the way.

"I saw the vampire's figure down this direction. Most probably he is going to the docks.", Nai shouted over the loud Loxodon steps.

"And where is the chubby piece of blood?", Shinigami giggled glaring at the cleric.

Loxodon snorted angrily trough his trunk.

"No matter, let's focus on tracing down the Vampire.", Nai made a quick turn down a crumbling flight of stairs, "Don't fall behind!"

...

# End of chase

You are standing next to a small building pressed in an alley between
two warehouses. There are no windows in the surrounding walls. There
is a small stone bridge going diagonaly between the upper levels of
the warehouses. The bridge casts a shadow on the alley.

A flickering blueish magic flame letters read "Gob's Barel" above the
door.

"I am pretty sure the Vampire went through this door.", Nai spoke
silently.

Flimsy metal door leads into a small square room, illuminated by few
magic torches.

In the dead center of the room a goblin sits on a barrel. Goblin
wears a dirty grey jumpsuit, his chest is naked, top half of the
jumpsuit is hanging on his belt. He has a single shimmering bronze
ring in his ear. His shoulders have intrinsic line artwork tattoos.

He smiles towards the party and raises a metal cup in his hand:

"Welcom' guests! Name's Gob, zib for a cup'o'ale!"

Barrel is full of rainwater, there is an illusion spell cast on the water.
Water tastes and smells like good brew. Any investigation roll reveals that this is water.
High investigation roll gives a detail that the barrel looks just like a rain barrel
you passed moments ago.

Gob can tell that he is the owner of this proud place.
Gob can tell that he has been serving ale ever since he left the Mizzium Brothers.
Gob can not tell when that happened, he just say "ages ago".
If inquired do guests come here often, after a confused silence, he states that
the party are the first guests ever. For that he offers the first cup free.

It should be abundantly clear that the goblin had his mind altered. He has nothing to do with the Vampire.

There is a door on the opposite end of the wall, hidden behind an illusion
spell. Magic detection or manual touching can clearly show the door.

# Dmir shadow

Door leads to another room, also dimly lit. Room has some broken furniture on the sides and two chairs in the middle.

Chairs are standing opposite from one another.

One of the chairs has traces of fresh blood, sliver of red hair stuck on
chipped wood and a tiny tear of green expensive looking fabric.

Room has an open trapdoor in the corner.

Footprints, fresh blood smears, and other clues may lead out of the sewers. All are left by Linda.

As you emerge from the sewers into a small secluded garden, you hear a woman sobing behind a statue.
It is Linda.
Her dress torn to shreds, bruised arms bleeding and hair is all messed up.
She is kneeling on the grass with her face in her palms.

When she sees you, she begs to take her back to prison for all that she has done.
She was brainwashed into accepting all guilt.
