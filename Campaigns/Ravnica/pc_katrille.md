# Backstory

I was living a peaceful idyllic life in city's outskirts surrounded by nature
and quiet. I spent all of my days observing wildlife and enjoying clean air out
of the city's noise. One of my favourite activities was swimming in a crystal
clear lake just near my house and feeling all of my thoughts and worries
dissipating in calmness of deep water. One day everything changed... all water
arround our district became strangely cloudy and air became noxious and hard to
breathe. This lasted only few days, but as everyone thought this was just some
accident in the city even stranger things started to happen. All district's
inhabitants that where of elvish descent were falling ill and died few weeks
after in agony and pain. This plague affected only one race and everybody else
were completely fine, so this looked like some ethnic cleaning. Always being
curious about all the things that are strange and unexplained, I was very
interested in finding out what happened. So I moved to the city's central area
and joined Simic laboratory. All the knowledge and experimentation I am getting
there takes a hold of all my time and thoughts.

## Interlude Katrille and Neirius

In the days of research, my paths oftenly crossed with multitude of other
researchers. I have spend days, sometimes even weeks in Prism University,
deepening my knowledge in biology and chemistry. From all the aquaintances I
have made, one had stood out by his stuborness and secrecy. I met him in the
library, near the mana transmutation section. He stood there with book in his
thin arms, with darkened eyes from exhaustion, it appeared that he will
collapse any moment from exhaustion.

-- "Hey, are you feeling well?", - I asked him.

-- "... two flux capacitors connected in reverse, powering a
transmoglificator...", - he mumbled something barely comprehensible.

-- "You seem exhausted, what are you working on?"

He slammed the book shut and looked me straight in to the eye.

-- "You are new here, aren't you?", - he asked with noticible irritation.

His eyes scanned my composture and the remnants of my failed experiments all
over my skin. His gaze softened.

-- "Yes I am new... Would you like to show me around? And maybe get some rest
while you are at it?", - I pressed on.

He pondered for a moment, slighlty shifting back and forward, as if standing on
two legs required mental fortitude.

-- "Agreed, if you never ever ask another scientist what he is working on."

We walked out from the library and he talked about the university and all the
knowledge that is enclosed in these walls. When we reached the inner fountain,
he took out something that resembled a piece of old bread, asked if I wanted
some, took a bite and collapsed on the lush grass. I jumped to his exhausted
body with fear that his life hjad just left him, but it seemed that he simply
fell asleep. I had no idea how long he had pushed himself, but somehow he
looked like a type I would like to stick around to. While he slept, I sneaked
into the book he was carrying. It was an advanced mana manipulation technique
discussion. Written by a pair of scientists little short of two hundred years
ago. After almost four hours of reading he woke up.

-- "How do you think, is it possible to artificialy create Black Lotus?",- he
asked about a legendary mana emiting plant.

-- "I am not sure, but if it is possible, it would make a breakthrough in all
scientific areas...",- for the last few hours I've been reading about failed
experiments of "Spontainious Mana Emition", which should, in theory, replicate
the effect of Black Lotus.

And so I met with Neirius. We used to have these long conversations about our
research, never stating what we are doing, but asking for opinions on various
questions that gave us problems at the time. After I delved deeper into work
within Simic Combine, I no longer had the time to visit University on weekly
basis, so our friendship grew distant.

I was working in the lab late when a knock on the door startled me. I nearly
dropped a vial of bioluminating acid leeches. I opened the door with a ghastly
glowing vial in my left hand.

--"Can I help you?"

--"Please miss, a letter for you", - a young pale boy was standing wet in the
coridor. His clothing was driping with some sort of liquid. He handed me a
paper leter, shimering with resistance magic.

--"Where did you manage to get this wet?", - I curiously inclined.

--"Stepped into a pothole, miss",- he exhaled with frustration,-"Simic
laboratories are hard to navigate for a surface boy, miss".

--"Here", - I handed him quarter zib, -"Get some warm food for the effort"

--"Thank you, miss",- his hand quickly grabbed my coin, -"You are most kind",-
he mumbled and scooted away.

I took a closer look at the letter. Izzet seal. Familiar handwriting:

    Dear friend,
    Please meet me at my laboratory in The Blistercoils, between
    Sullemand's and Sunnix's before sun sets tonight.
    I beg for your help, Neirius

When I hastily finished my research and walked up to Blistercoils it was
already past sunset. Empty streets were quiet. I made a turn into a dark alley
to shortern the walk and nearly slamed into a large loxodon.
