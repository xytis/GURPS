#Scene 3: Talk with Neirius

He urges the party to finish the experiment he has started. He gives out that
someone has sabotaged his plans and that his working party was attacked by
Golgari when he has almost finished the Mana Siphon which would give Izzet a
possibility to convert any type of mana into pure energy in large scale. His
life work is imbued in that device and he simply can not stand the idea that it
will fall into someone's else hands. Or even worse -- that someone from Izzet
will claim that research for their own name. He wanted to give a name of a mage
that might help the party, Sabite Eyne, a veldaken researcher who has the
mental ability to understand Neirius work. But he is afraid that she already
has claimed his work in her own name. He asks two things: to reclaim the
artefact from Golgari teritory and to check if Sabite has betrayed him.
