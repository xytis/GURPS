#Scene: Mister Elion Norberos, the legendary bowyer

Within a small clearing in the thick woods, a long livewood house, with an old
mossy roof stands in the morning mist. A tall elf with white curly hair and a
dark look in his eyes greets you.

--"What do you want?"- he asks somewhat annoyed by your presence.

--"We heard you could make a pair of bows..."- you humbly ask.

--"I can, and I do, but not for you."- and closes the door.

--"We came willing to do you a favour!"- you shout at the closed door.

You hear soft steps backing up to the door. Wooden hinges softly murmurs
as the door slowly peeks open.

--"How determined are you?"- elf's voice suddenly has this sinister note to it.
He speaks as if it was a song and his melody suddenly turned dark.

#Quest "Bowstring from a jellyfish"

Elion describes to you a fish, that swims in the deepest of the oceans, and has
tendrils as light as the air itself and as strong as the best alloys of Izzet.

--"Fetch me those tendrils, and if you succeed, you will both be rewarded with
my bows."- Mister Norberos starts,-"If you die, I will name two of my bows in
your names. How's that for a deal?"
