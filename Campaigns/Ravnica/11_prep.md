# Intro
## Rainbucket Inn

You feel the early summers sun peek through the windows. You raise in your
bunk beds. Some have slept peacefuly, some had dreams and some can't shake
the feeling they were cheated by Orzhov in the Arena yesterday.

There is a fresh smell of something burnt coming from downstairs.


## Messenger from Neirius

A tall boy, almost coming of age waves at one of the party members.
He rushes forward, he has a bag over his shoulder and a weird device
in his hand. On aproach he shufles among multiple sheets of paper
and produces a scrapy note.

> Tonight I will require your participation. Meet me at the laboratory few
> hours after midday.
>
> Neirius
>
> P.S. Payment comes after task.

## A glimpse of familiar boy

name: Jack
appearance: Ragged clothes, few scratches on his arms and legs, a swolen eye.

Between the crowd you notice a familiar small boy, running through from one
alley to another. He is under his breath.

"I am not safe, it is after me!", he seems terrified and wants protection.  He
offers his favour in exchange for saving him from the "watery monster".

## Job under the Gore House

"It is quite simple, actualy. I need to place Artifimana Siphon as close to the
center of arena as possible. And since placing it on arena is beyond insanity,
I suggest we go under."
