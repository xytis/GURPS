If they follow the pickaxe to the Tin Street, they can find the stall with
multiple identical pickaxes. The stall-keeper is a young human boy, Jaxon, around
16 years old. He is not very helpful, unless he is given a hefty sum, or
interrogated in other means.

He say that his father Obediah, a fine smith works in the Sixth district, close
to the Foundry street.

Clues that can be given:

- A young woman came over today, and bought two pickaxes. She looked stunning,
    with a long dark dress and pale skin. Her arms were quite long. She picked two
    identical pickaxes and ordered her thrull to carry them. Then she paid in gold
    and left.
- Large looking Rakdos Cultist bought a replacement for his pickaxe, he chose
    one of the larger ones, almost ogre sized. He seemed to swing it easily.
- An Azorius Lawmage came through today, asked if there was any problems regarding
    Rakdos or Gruul in the last few days, wrote down my statement and left.
- Most probably this pickaxe in particular was stolen when the boy was not looking.
    He figures that out and asks to return the pickaxe. He points to other stalls,
    maybe older merchants saw who stole a pickaxe.

# NPC Beggar Annabelle

Looking around they see an old woman who stares dead on at them. She is sitting
in the corner, with a small cup in front of her and a weird looking furry hat on
top of her head. She is a tad crazy and speaks in breaking voice. Sometimes
mumbles something out of the context.

- Poor boy, his father will scold him, for he lost three pickaxes only today.
- Yes, I saw, I see many things. Spirits talk to me, birds sing to me. Even stones
    tell their stories.
- Why should I tell you anything? You are standing on my favourite stone!
- Ok, ok, Ana speaks. But give Annabelle some food! No, not the vile Golgari shit!
    I want cherries!
- He was tall and Vedalken. His blue hand had a number written on it. 17.
