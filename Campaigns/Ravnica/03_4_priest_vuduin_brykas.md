# Scene: visit of priest Vuduin Brykas

A lone Selesnya priest comes to the hut and knocks on the doorframe.

--"Blessings from Mat'Selesnya, how are your animals, Wyn?"

--"I have had my hands full for the last few weeks. I find more and more signs
of death in my forest patch, it seems that while Guildpact is missing, our
forests are like a buffet for savages from the rubblebelt."

--"Have the rangers been of any assistance? I talked with sanctuary guardian
about your forests, I hope some help will come your way."- the priest looks
over the back of the hut, where Neirius is lying. -"Am I interupting
something?"

---

Goal of the priest is to extract as much information about Neirius and other
members of the party as possible. Priest introduces himself as Vuduin Brykas,
Priest of Mat'Selesnya.
