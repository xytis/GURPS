# Waking in the depths

You summon the scythe back from the gaping portal. Seems nothing bad had happened to it.
By Rakdos name, this science sure is complicated, you can't even slice it open.

As the fight is over you feel something strange happening on the shaft of your
weapon. As if a demon would purr in your palm. You put your ear to it. A
silent growl reaches your hearing.
