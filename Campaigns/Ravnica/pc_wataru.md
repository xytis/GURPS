# Backstory

At my youth I was a drifter. While I was born and raised in Selesnya, I was not
the standard Selesnya material. My desire for knowledge drove me further into
the dangerous zone and out of calm and communal groves of Enclave.

I hoped one guild after another. I was silent and invisible scholar who spend
days in libraries or lectures. Since I had no ambition, nobody memorised me.
That way I spend decades in Azorius and Selesnya libraries. And I even bribed
old locksmith Manfred to show me the library of Orzhov Cathedral.

Somewhere in that cathedral I found a manuscript. And in that roll there was a
prophesy: "Only a great beast mastering the thunder clouds will know the recipe
for true immortality." This pushed me into the direction, for in my youthful
ignorance I imagined myself as that great beast.

***

"A phant in Izzet arctower?" She laughed "Keep your tusks inside, unless you
want to become lightnin' rod"

Minerwa was a strict supervisor. And a crazy scientist. Like all of them in
Izzet guild. She never stopped teasing me about the thunder-phant though. Even
after we became close friends.

I don't know how it happen that we became more then just friends. But alas that
was how things became. Over the next few decades she helped me to further my
understanding of weather and storm clouds. And how not to spend evenings alone.

***

However, all this time I knew that all devouring time was our true enemy. I did
not know that the time for our final goodbye would come some soon.

***

I remember that day quite often. And the question that I cant answer is always
through my mind: "was I always so reckless, or was it my life in Izzet that
made me so". Whatever the answer to this question is, that doesn't change what
happened.

I spend 2 years preparing for that experiment: a contraption that would allow
me to manipulate storm clouds and thunder. That would be the first step to
immortality!

On my 100th birthday Me and Minerwa were at my lab. I turned on the device and
the plan ended there. Three hours later I stumbled away from the district fire.
Tens of buildings were destroyed, and several people died, my lover included.

Great fires are not uncommon in Izzet, and it was impossible to determine where
the origin was, so nobody came looking for me. But my days in Izzet were over. 

In the fiery hell of district fire an angel appeared before me and led me to
safety. If not for her, my life would have ended there.

***

Traumatised, with my life and my hopes shattered I drifted around Ravnica
without any clear goal. Everything seemed bleak. How could I continue living,
when I destroyed the love of my life.

However, couple days after the fire I raised my eyes and realised that I'm in
the place that I was seeking. No, not the groves of Selesnya, they would take
me, and nurture me, but that was not what I wanted.

I stood at the gates of Boros. The place where Angels walked besides the
mortal. I don't know the name of Angel that led me out of the fire, and I never
found her. I call her the Nameless Angel and she is the inspiration I follow. 

I spend decades as an acolyte in Boros, training in medicine and I even learned
some healing magic. However, recently, while praying to the Nameless, I invoked
lightning between my hands. And my childish dreams rekindled. 

This time the first step of prophesy is completed. Who could have though that
this would happen not though experiments in Arctower, but through devotion and
faith at the chapel of Boros?

Maybe I am "the great beast who masters the thunder clouds" after all?

# Interlude Wyn Zumro

Wataru in his early childhood roamed the forests of Selesnya. He was active and
pettish for an elephant. One morning while striding down the eastern forests
young loxodon found an injured brushstrider. It's wounds were severe, it had
multiple arrows sticking out of it's large neck and few nasty cuts on it's
elegant body. Wataru ran to the nearest forest keeper's hut, slammed through
the door and in gabbled:

--"Brushstrider!... Arrows!... Blood!... Help!..."

An elder elf was kneeling next to a small crib and feeding something from a
small milk bottle. He stood up, and quite surprised by the anxiety shown by a
loxodon calmly asked:

--"Speak slower, child. What happened?"

--"I was walking in the forest, ... a brushstrider, next to a large pine, ...
blood and arrows!"

Seeing that little elephants eyes were filling with tears, elf took his healing
kit, his staff and pointed to the door:

--"Show me, child."

Wataru scuddled out through the door and without looking back charged straight
through the forest. Elf had to jog to keep up with the flurried loxodon.

***

--"Can we name it?"- Wataru asked.

--"I doubt he will need names, child, but you can give him some leaves to eat."

A large brushstrider was lying on hay, all bandaged up and resting.

--"Mister, what is your name?"

--"Zumro, but you can call me Wyn. How should I call you, little elephant?"

***

Zumro's place became one of the favourite spots to spend time for young Wataru.
Mister Wyn, as Wataru called him, was a talented healer, who took care of the
animals in the eastern forests. Lately there were more and more raids as the
Gruul became agitated for some reason, thus there were a lot of injured animals
and plants that needed Wyn's attention. Wataru was not the only child who found
Zumro's place attractive. There were at least a dozen other Selesnyan children
helping to take care after the animals and nurturing saplings in the little
garden behind foresters hut.

Wataru made many acquaintances during his time in Zumro's hut, most notable of
which was a young elven girl, named Neia, and two human twins Martin and
Sebastian.

# Dream: The journey to the Angel

You see sandstone tiles under your feet. You are standing on a bridge hanging
afloat in a sea of grey clouds. Bridge goes forward over this never ending sea.
Far in the distance you can barely see a dark figure. Behind that figure, dark
tumbling clouds are forming. Lightning flashes. Figure's silhouette takes shape
in the blue light. Two large wings are spread out. Tunic, or maybe a cloak, is
flapping in the raising wind. You think you saw a glimpse of her face.

"Angel!", you hear yourself shout over the rumbling thunder.

You start running.

Suddenly the world shifts sideways. You slip from the bridge and fall into the
clouds. Grey clouds go past you faster and faster. You hit something solid.
Your body locks up for a brief moment. You exhale in pain. Your breath escapes
your mouth as a stream of bubbles. You are underwater. There is no light. You
sense no direction. Suddenly something starts pulling you. You fight against it.

> Athletics check DC 15:

> Failure: You are trying to swim away. Tugging continues and gets stronger.
> Your lungs start burning. +1 DC on Constitution

> Success: You plow against the force that pulls you down. You feel like you
> are raising. Your chest aches from lack of air. -1 DC on Constitution.

> Constitution saving throw DC 15:

> Failure: You give up and breathe in water. Burning stops. There is a cold
> feeling in your lungs. Your vision clarifies. You look down. There is a
> pack of ghosts grasping at you. With newfound strength you fight against
> the pull. -2 DC on Athletics.

> Success: You kick and struggle. Your lungs are aflame. You look down and see
> a pack of ghosts grasping you and pulling you down. +2 DC on Athletics.

> Athletics check DC 15:

> Success -> Success: You fight against the ghostly hands. They give way.
> Failure -> Success: You fight against the ghostly embrace. It seems you need
> just a little more to break free. +1 DC on Constitution

> Success -> Failure: Your plows seem futile against the horde of undead.
> Failure -> Failure: Ghosts tug you down among them. You scream in despair.
> Water fills your lungs.

> To raise above water, you need 2 success rolls of Athletics. After first
> Constitution failure you no longer need to make any of those. After each
> Athletics check, you need too make Constitution saving throw.

> 2 Athletics failures means the ghosts pulled you down. You wake up soaked
> in sweat. Simic transformation will take place. In addition to that you are
> visited by undead tax collector this evening.

You break the surface. You wake up.

 * Failure on Con save:
     You sit down, there is a burning sensation in your lungs. You feel blood in your mouth.
     Simic transformation will take place fully over the next three days.

 * Success on Con save:
     You sit down. You feel an itch on your neck. Something feels like stuck in your throat.
     You try to clear it and start coughing. You spit out a wet blob of some sort.
     Simic transformation will not proceed.
