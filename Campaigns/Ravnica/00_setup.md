# Setup

A mage from Izzet guild, Neirius, had borrowed money from Orzhov to fund
construction of a mana gathering artefact. But few experiments got out of hand
due to interference from other guilds and Neirius had been pressed in a corner
by Orzhov enforcers. He sent out a cry for help to all his acquaintances hoping
that someone would lend a hand.

# Note

Note which falls into each players hands gives out the information about failed
Izzet experiment and the location of the Neirius lab deep in Precinct Five.
Neirius begs to meet him before the sun sets today, in the lab.

    Dear friend,
    Please meet me at my laboratory in The Blistercoils, between Sullemand's
    and Sunnix's before sun sets tonight.
    I beg for your help, Neirius

# NPC: Neirius

A slim human, with white frizzy hair, some freckles on his pale skin. Usually
works with a smile on his lips and vigor in his slender fingers. In the recent
years became more reserved. Closest friends know that he is working on
something that could change the world as it is now. But no one knows what he is
doing exactly.
