# NPC: Neirius

A slim human, with white frizzy hair, some freckles on his pale skin.
Usually works with a smile on his lips and vigor in his slender
fingers. In the recent years became more reserved. Closest friends
know that he is working on something that could change the world as it
is now. But no one knows what he is doing exactly.
