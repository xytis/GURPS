# Intro

Evening is busy as always in the Fire and Water inn. Your table
has a plate of meats, bread and cheese. A large jug with local
ale has a bit of condensate on it. You have a free weekend from
your duties and from your contract with Neirius. There are a number of
notes on the notice board.

# Notice board

## Trizz wants to make a stronger brew

A small paper note hangs on the metal door to the Fire and Water inn.

> Will buy fresh or pre-fermented Trickle Fruit in large amounts. Price negotiable.

If inquired, Jura points that Trizz, her love and co-owner of this inn, is searching
for these fruits that are known to grow in the South. But for the last few months
no fruit had came to the Tin Street markets.

"Si, I come from far south myself, and I know the chorrito is suited for my needs.
But something has gotten wrong with the trade. No fruits came during this season."

## Wanted posters

An Azorius scout comes in and takes down two posters. One with The Wet Slayer and
one with Krenko, the arms dealer who escaped prison few days ago.

He places three more bounties.

> Murderous ghost in the tunnels below Tin Street. Merchants be advised. 20 zinos if proven disposed.

> Street fights out of grasp in Foundry Street. Assistance against Gruul incursions
> rewarded with 5 zino bounty per head.

> Public trial of Linda Moisuz, evidence of her guilt regarding Guildpact violations
> are rewarded. Please contract officer Tamid Luade for further details.

### Murderous ghost

Few turns below the Tin street you come across a rubble filled corridor. Even though it is filled
with debrie, you see a large amount of footprints.

A single goblin by the name of Grxtract is upset by his death. He calls out to anyone aproaching
him, to stay away, before engaging in combat. He claims that his death was organised and he wants
a proper claim in courts of Azorius. He has a family of seven children and a wife that is still
pregnant by his memory. He claims that his life was taken in directed assasination and requires
a wojek to investigate it. If the party tries to bypass him, he goes into nercomantic rage and
attacks, his orders are to let no creatures pass.

His wife is already dead. His ghost was returned to plane of Ravnica by a necromancer Gus Ler,
who wishes to protect an infestation of vegepygmys. One of the Mizzium Brothers is the latest
son of Grxtract. He now goes by the name of Yrtrzx. His father's ghost hints that his latest son
is the smartest of the lot. Even in his young age he should have joined Izzet.

An infestation can be combated or reported.

Iron door at the end of the corridor opens by great effort into a lush
underworld garden. There is a sickly sweet smell in the air. Movement between
the large mushrooms is clear. A tribe of Vegepygmys attacks the trespassing
party.

### Street fights

Foundry street is bustling with goblins, well built humans and imps. You walk on the cobblestones
as you see signs of recent incursion. There is blood on the stones and several buildings collapsed
in the vicinity. Local vendors have moved their stalls further away from the huge pile of debrie
that once was a building. Kruul scavengers are traversing the rubble, together with dirty humanoids,
each searching for something. Behind the pile of stone and bricks you see an opening, with trees
and dried out grass.

A heavy patrol of Boros is present in the area.

You see a single viashino climbing the rubble and tracing his path in the high grass behind it.

- Armid
  Viashino scout.
  "I am not in no trouble. I go, sell pretty stone, return. No harm, good for clan."
  He was the part of the last raid. He can tell how he found the stone after his leader
  smashed one of the bigger walls in. He is carrying a spear, a bow and an extra warhammer,
  which does not fit his physique.

  He is part of Rukta clan. He wants to give the warhammer to Bren, for she had organised
  this incursion.

  "Bren - fierce. Knows when to strike. She got deal, we use it. Now we have weapons.
  We take place of big clan. Bren lead us."

- Brenna
  "Sister! Long time no see! What brings you to my tribe? Finnaly want to fight?"
  She tries not to say "Ylva" in front of other members, but whispers that to her ear.
  She is planning a claim to the leader of Gruul, but she needs help against Borogymoros.
  And it has to be clean, as the tribe rules command. A weapon or armor would help.

### Public trial

- Tamid Luade
  Field officer in Azorius. Is responsible for gathering evidence against Linda Moisuz.
  Claiming party: Golgari, responding party: Simic. Claim: Targeted biological warfare
  impeding the daily responsibilities of a guild. He works as a cleric in New Prahv. His black
  hair are combed to one side, he has a double chin, which compliments his fatty build.
  He wishes to avoid actual field work and tries to reach a promotion where he works from
  behind one of the numerous desks in heights of New Prahv.

- Linda Moisuz
  Necromantic bioengineer, last one in the chain of released Simic experiments. Her creation,
  Spitting greyflower was deployed across Golgari farms is causing more trouble than solving.
  She wishes to contract unaligned parties to kill off violent speciments. She claims that her
  creation was not connected to any other parties. She has a small lab below the forges in
  Foundry street. Her owned area borders the great chasm which goes down as far as eye can see.
  She is young, human, her hair is red and she has visible scars on her hands. She dresses in
  a brown overall.

  Golgari had created bug eating plants to combat the parasites from Simic combine.

- Mortimer Lan
  Deal maker between Linda and Golgari. He is affiliated with Orzhov, his mother in law
  is related to a true blood pontif. He is trying to find efforts that would bring him
  in favour with the guild. He claims that the deal was fair. Golgari wanted the waspcrabs
  taken care of. Side effect of plants atacking zombie workforce is not covered in his contracts.
  He wishes to take care of this manner with minimal cost. When pressed he can cover extra
  payment for each violent greyflowers. But he wishes to trade favour for it instead.
