# Way to life

Grim atmosphere loomed in the small sparsely decorated room.

--"So, what are we going to do with the dead elephant in the room?"- Shinigami
broke the silence, slowly poking thick loxodon's skin with her flute.

--"I know of a scientific way to bring our friend here back from the astral
plane. It requires a tiny bit of science and a skilled biochemist."- Katrille
started, -"When I was learning in the Prism university, we had a course about
revivification potions. To my knowledge it is possible to brew such concoction.
But we need some help."

--"We're listening..."- Nai seemed anxious to hear how to raise the 'phant.

--"Let's go to Zonot, scientists there can easily make us a potion."- Katrille
stated matter of factly.

--"Poink."- Shinigami pushed her flute into eye socket of the elephant.

--"Who are you doing? You attacked him on first meeting, now you are disgracing
his body?!"- Nai suddenly burst.

--"Maybe he is still sleeping? I want to be sure..."- Shinigami continued to
probe the corpse.

--"Ah, in the name of all that is still living, stop doing that!"- Nai turned
her eyes away, -"Katrille, how far is this Zonot?"

--"If we get a guide out of Selesnyan woods and reach Tin street, I would say,
four hours walk?"

--"And where are we..."- Nai's sentence was interrupted by a creaking door.
Elven woman came in with a tamed wolf by her side. -"Oh, now you show up!"

--"What happened? Wataru? By the grace of Mat'Selesnya, what have you done to
him?"- Neia, elf they met in the forests day ago, froze with a shocked
expression on her face.

--"We were cleaning the Gruul incursion in _your_ forests, when Wataru took an
axe to his face."- Nai spoke looking the elf straight in her dark eyes.

--"I,... we..."- Neia stammered, -"I just returned from Sunhome, where we
delivered Wataru's friend and his note. You should have waited for me..."

--"Well, we did what we thought was necessary to repay your old man. And it
went slightly overboard."- Nai exhaled deeply, -"Look, we are going to bring
this 'phant back to the realm of the living. For that we need to get to...
Again, Katrille, where should we go?"

--"Zonot Seven, research chambers below Prism University."- vedalken replied
with dry voice.

--"Yeah, there. So can you lead us through your forests?"

--"I can, what about Wataru's body?"

Everybody turned their eyes to the dead loxodon, who's gray skin was now
decorated by multiple renditions of male genitals.

--"Yep, he is definitely dead."- Rakdos performer said with pride in her voice
while finishing her work.

--"I can wrap his body in preserving stasis",- old elf in the corner spoke up,
-"it should stay fresh until you come back."

Wyn suppressed the urge to add an "if" in his sentence. He overlooked the
inexperienced party judging their capabilities.

--"In ten days I will perform a proper burial to the fallen."

--"We leave at dawn."- Nai did not even bother to ask the old elf's permission
to stay for the night.

...

With the first rays of the morning sun, party led by Neia, paced through the
waking forest. After spending last few days in the nature Nai and Katrille were
starting to see the differences in trees and undergrowth between the tidy
Selesnyan and wild Gruul territories. Shinigami on the other hand was too
focused on her flute to pay any sane attention to changing surroundings.

--"Careful, we are now in Gruul territories, we should..."- Neia's warning was
cut short by weird chirping sound from the Rakdos flute.

--"Yeah..."- Nai stroked back her long dark hair in disbelief. -"At least let's
spread out a little."

Party, apart from Shinigami, moved carefully forward, keeping their eyes peeled
for any signs of ambush or Gruul marauders. Without even saying a word, the
three girls reached an uniform decision to use Rakdos musician as a walking
bait. Couple of minutes later elf spotted a wild maaka.

--"I think it is on a hunt. What should we do?"- Neia wanted to simply walk
away, she was not fond of killing any living creature without a good reason.
And in her mind, she was the one trespassing, not unlike the Gruul in Selesnyan
forests.

--"I don't think it saw us yet, we could simply move around..."- Nai's tactical
plan was cut short by a loud note from a flute, which, did actually sound a bit
like a large cat. -"Ah, forget it."

Large cat like creature, with brown fur and dark stripes on it's back, started
circling the group, with it's eyes locked on the origin of this ruckus - pale
Rakdos girl.

Elf hid in the thick leaves, while human climbed a nearby tree, getting a
better view of the situation. Vedalken snapped her fingers and a white owl
appeared on her shoulder. She whispered something and the owl flew toward the
approaching predator. Owl circled the ferocious cat, meaning to provide a
distraction, yet maaka was already fixated on a juicy human.

Arrows flew from the tree and the bushes, sinking deeply into the back of the
predator. An icy blast came from another side and slammed into the furry torso.
Melting ice and blood from the arrow wounds colored the fur and started
dripping down.

Shinigami stopped playing her flute moments before wild cat leaped forward with
deadly claws aimed to pin down the girl. Rakdos girl playfully jumped aside,
dodging the beast and laughed.

--"Oh you poor thing, I will skin you alive!"- with these words a large black
sphere appeared around both Shinigami and the bleeding creature.

Remaining party members watched the sphere with disbelief. Meanwhile inside it,
in complete magical darkness, maaka's eyes went burning with rage. It was
cornered and scared. It lunged forward and sank it's teeth into Shinigami's
shoulder. She yelped and pushed against the large animal with all her strength
to no avail. Concentrating on the pain she felt, she spoke a single phrase in
infernal. Hellish flames spun around the predator. Fire in the eyes of the cat
dimmed and the creature with a painful roar succumbed to the spell.

The magical sphere contracted and disappeared, revealing now standing
Shinigami, probing charred remains. Party slowly gathered around the dead
beast.

--"Anyone hungry?"- Rakdos girl tried to appear frivolous, but her shoulder was
nearly torn off, blood was streaming down her arm.

--"Are you insane?"- Nai was not happy with these turn of events, -"We could
have just avoided the beast! Now look at you!"

--"It was just a little fun..."- Rakdos tried to protest.

--"Katrille, can you do something about her shoulder?"- Nai turned to the
vedalken scientist.

--"I can freeze it off, if that helps?"

--"Um, I'll be fine"- Shinigami carefully tried to assemble pieces of her
shoulder back.

--"Don't worry, here, push this into the wound."- Katrille handed her a blue
teardrop.

--"Thanks. Ow ow ow ow..."- with the healing magic from the Simic teardrop
fresh skin covered teeth holes in her shoulder, but the blood spill beneath the
skin colored nearly half of the pale girl in purple.

--"At least you will not bleed to death now. I don't want to have another body
to raise from the dead."- Nai complained.

Nai turned around and walked pass the elf with a hungry looking wolf by her
side.

--"Go on, boy, have a bite."- Neia let her wolf to feast on the remains, and
walked after Nai, -"Listen, we, um, we should be more careful here."

--"Why are you telling me this?"- Nai looked around for a larger tree, and
started climbing it all the way to the top.

--"You seem like a leader here?"- elf statement hung in the now peacefully
chirping and singing forest.

Over the tree tops she could see a Gruul encampment about 30 minutes to the
north. Nai came back and shared her findings with the group.

--"Oh, oh, we should go there!"- Shinigami jumped up and down.

--"Are you sure you were not hit on your head recently?"- Nai thought for a
second, -"Oh, riiight. Nevermind that. No, we are not going into Gruul camp.
Look at us. A Simic scientist, a Selesnyan ranger, Rakdos performer, and, well,
me. We are not friends of the Gruul. And we are covered in their blood from the
last few days."

--"I agree with Nai."- Katrille nodded.

--"We should move."- Neia interrupted, as her wolf raised it's head listening
to something deep in the forest.

...

They carefully moved through the remaining of Gruul rubble without any further
incidents, mostly because they kept Shinigami away from singing and playing her
flute.

As the reclaimed landscape gave way to standing buildings and paved streets,
party turned directly to Tin street. Sun hung directly above their heads, the
street was filled with smells of freshly baked meat, noises of haggling and
lots and lots of people. Nai clenched her pouch just to be sure no soul would
try to separate her and her hard earned coin. Shinigami dove into nearest alley
and swapped her bloody leather clothing, which was more like a web of straps
and chains than a normal apparel, to something less eye-catching. Neia took her
wolf by it's collar and moved through the thick of the flow, watching carefully
for her new pet. Vedalken simply walked directly towards Zonot Seven, expecting
others would follow her through the crowd.

Better part of the next hour they navigated through densely populated area of
Blistercoils, and came to the eastern side of Zonot Seven. A huge hole with
waterfalls from all sides went down as much as they could see.

--"Ok, our goal is directly on the other side."- Katrille anounced, -"We want
to go through Prism University, or living quarters and maintenance side?"

--"Let's go straight!"- Shinigami proposed.

--"It is said that it goes down to the underground ocean. I would not recommend
jumping in. It is quite the fall."- Katrille replied with dry vedalken
precision.

--"Prism University sounds good to me. Let's go."- Nai commanded.
