# Hand of the numbered

The girls exited the damp and magilit Zonot back to the surface.

--"I will leave you now. I feel that Wataru soul is bound to return to his body
soon, and the song is calling me back to my duty in the forest."- Neia looked
longingly at the clear skies, -"Blessings of Mat'Selesnya to you all".

The party looked after the elvish girl and her wolf striding into the alleys of
Blistercoils.

--"We should start with Tin street. I have a hunch that this pickaxe originated
there."- Nai gave her thoughts on the subject.

--"Lead the way"- Katrille nodded, eyeing Shinigami with suspicion, who was
swinging her hips playfully to the sides, making her short simple skirt swirl
in the warm afternoon breeze.

The relatively quiet streets of Fifth district gave way to the bustling Tin
Street. Lively market was full of action and people, food vendors were trying
to sell of the last bits of grilled meat from their carts, some merchants were
already packing up their stalls, was it because the day was not going well for
them, or they have sold all that they wanted today it remains unclear. Criers
from stalls at the edges of the street tried to get attention from passers-by
in any way they could.

--"Wait here, I am going to look around"- Nai disappeared into the crowd faster
than anyone could protest.

--"Would you like some rat sticks?"

--"What?"- Katrille looked surprised at the Rakdos performer, currently
behaving completely differently than she was used to.

--"Rat sticks. Grilled rats on a stick."- girl pointed to a nearby goblin,
which had impaled gutted rodents sizzling atop his portable grill.

--"Um, can we have something that has less of, um, rat?"

--"How about that one"- her finger moved to large banner "Myzterius Meatz",
which was owned by a sturdy looking female ogre, giving out large sausages to
her customers.

--"I would prefer something which I know is meat..."- vedalken skimmed over the
closest stalls -"There, a 'bab stall."

A leaf decorated wooden stall, with slim human slicing juicy looking pale meat
and placing it into brownish spice mix, before tossing it onto a huge pan over
a marble stove, where a chubby woman saw to a perfect roast. Soon girls dug
into steaming meat and vegetable plates standing at the little table nearby.

Meanwhile Nai was looking for anything that would help them to figure out who
attacked Biochemist Iosif. Her keen eye noticed a crew of Rakdos miners pushing
through the crowd. They were sweaty and had a disconcertingly strong odor
around them. Most probably they were just out of the depths of Hellhole,
perhaps trying to unearth something long lost. Nai followed the miner crew
until they reached a stall fully stocked with metal tools.

--"Hey, boy, do you have a pickaxe?"

--"Vincenc, he has nothing but pickaxes. Just pick one and lets go, we have a
lot to do."

--"Boy, give me a discount, I have broken one, and I need a new one."- towering
man pushed over a large broken tool the stall. -"How much?"

--"Whi-which pickaxe do you want?"- boy behind the stall stammered a bit,
seeing the large leather wearing figures, with menacing spikes and piercings
throughout their muscular bodies.

--"This will do"- Vincenc pointed to the closest pickaxe, similar to the one he
used before.

--"That one will be a zino and 59 zibs."- boy started pulling out the tool from
the rack.

--"Make a discount or we will use it on you first!"- the smallest of the group,
but still a large human hissed at the poor boy and showed his artificially
sharpened teeth in a threatening smile.

--"Y-yes sir. One twenty, no less."- boy hoped that the group would not attack
him in broad daylight, but he was not entirely certain. He looked at the little
flag bearing the symbol of the Church of Deals, hanging at the end of the stall
banner, praying that the protection he bought had any impact on these brutes.

Low thick laughter from Vincenc's mouth pushed out the remainder of the blood
from already pale boys face. He threw the coin on the counter, grabbed the tool
from the shivering hands and gestured his comrades to go. Before leaving, one
with gruesome smile feinted a swing from a tool he was holding, forcing the
merchant to cover his head with his arms.

Nai watched the group walk away and approached the stall.

--"Hey there, young man. What are you selling here?"

Boy watched the Rakdos crew for a while longer, then turned his gaze to his new
customer.

--"Tools and trinkets, young miss. What can I interest you in?"

--"What pickaxes you have?"

--"Uhm, here you can see all what we have to offer"- young boy gestured towards
side of his stand, where various mining tools were layed out. Starting from
small, goblin sized utilities, to large, presumably giant wielded tools. -"Is
there anything specific you are looking for?"

--"Yes, I would like to inspect something my size."

--"What are you going to dig, if I may ask?"- boy tried to weave some sort of
conversation with the pretty girl, while unhooking a medium sized pickaxe.

--"I want to use it for climbing..."- Nai carefully inspected the tool she was
handed. It had the same marked price tag and the same blacksmiths signature as
the tool she found in the breeding pool a while ago. -"Say, do you have
anything else for me?"

--"Of course, if you plan on going somewhere high you can find all the tools
right here!"- merchant took a considerable sized drawer out from the side of
his stall and placed atop the merchandise.

All sorts of carabiners, chains, harnesses and rings, ascenders and descenders,
in addition to crampons for various size boots and multitude of hooks and
bolts.

--"Ok, great, thanks, I am going to look a bit around..."

--"Oh don't worry, you will find that Obediah's merchandise is best around
these parts."- boy shouted after Nai, with considerable pride in his tone.

...

--"So you just sat here and ate?"

--"Well, yes? What did you expect us to do? You disappeared in the crowd. And I
was hungry."- Shinigami protested. -"We got you some food too, here, have a
bite."

--"Ok, after I eat... Oh that looks really tasty, mhph..."- Nai continued with
full mouth, -"So, I found this stall were the pickaxe was acquired from. We
need to get more information from the boy behind it."

...

--"Look, we will not hurt you, but you better tell us what we want to hear."-
Shinigami looked menacingly at the poor boy behind the stall, who suddenly lost
his capability to speak.

--"Who have bought pickaxes recently?"- Nai asked the boy.

--"Rakdos"

--"What?"- Shinigami hissed

--"No, Rakdos came previously and bought a pickaxe, just before you came."

--"Who else?"

--"A girl, no, a woman. Pale skin, long dark dress. Purchased two, had thrulls
to carry them. Paid in gold coin."- boy paused for a bit, -"Also Azorius Lawmage
came here today, asked for any stolen goods, I reported what I lost today, he wrote
it down and left."

--"And yesterday?"

--"I... I did not work yesterday, my father tended to the stall."

--"Where is your father now?"

--"Working in the smith? He is the one making all these tools."

--"And where is the smith?"

--"Sixth district, close to the Foundry street. Has a name plate next to the
door."

--"This is going nowhere"- Nai intercepted, taking out pickaxe from her cloak,
-"Who bought this?"

--"I... I am sorry, don't tell my father about this. It was stolen today, I did
not see who did it.  I already told this to Lawmage..."

--"Don't worry, we are not here to blame you, we need to find the person who
took this. Actually, you can have it back."- Nai placed the tool back on the stall
and took a scanning look around.

Between two stalls on the opposite side, a beggar woman was staring intently at
the trio. Nai swam across the people filled street and stood above the old
looking lady with weird furry hat on top of her head. Nai took out three copper
coins and tossed them down to the small can in front of the old woman.
Beggar quickly grabbed the falling coins mid air, one coin hit the bottom of
the can, while others disappeared within her clothing somewhere. Nai bent down
and asked in hushed voice:

--"Did you see what or who took that pickaxe?"

--"Yes, I saw. I see many things. Spirits hush to me, birds sing to me. Even
stones complain to me. Could you kindly step a bit to the left, you are
trampling my favourite pebble."

--"What? Oh, yes, sure."- Nai took a careful side step, -"So what can you tell
me?"

--"He was tall, blue and vedalken. He was a bad thief. It took him almost a
minute to hide the damn thing under his cloak."

--"Anything more specific?"

--"What is your name girl?"

--"Nai, what about yours?"

--"Annabelle",- she make a little bow and seemingly on accident pushed her coin
tin with her knee.

Three more coins fell into the can.

--"Ok, I will tell you one more thing. But I need something from you. Get me
some cherries."

--"What?"

--"Cherries. Ripe ones at that."

Nai looked with confusion at Katrille.

--"Well you heard her. Bring some."

Katrille shook her head in disbelief and disappeared in the crowd. Moments
later she came back with a basket of cherries.

--"Please, all of you, don't mind to take some"- Annabelle placed the basket in
the middle so that everyone could reach. -"Oh they are so good. He had a
number. Mmm. Tattoo on his hand. You know, I really miss proper fruit, I mostly
have to persist on Golgari rot farms. Number seventeen, in calligraphic script.
But these cherries, they are really good. Just below his left sleeve."

--"Thank you, Annabelle."

--"You are welcome, Nai."

...

--"Seventeen you say? Oh dear. That is most disconcerting I may know only of
one vedalken who has a number on his hand. He is my, um, was a part of biomana
enhancement project. It was a success and his magic abilities had been
enhanced. He then became my associate and we worked for more than an decade
together. But something had gotten into him lately, and he started a movement
against Simic enhancements. I never thought he would be this ridiculous, to
come in to my laboratory and release all the creatures we worked on together."

Iosif turned to his pile of papers and took the top one.

--"He handed me this last time we met. I thought it was some sort of a joke,
but given his actions, I am afraid he lost his mind."

Leaflet shames Simic biomancy and warns that godless creations will rise and
attack the living.

--"Here is your potion",- biochemist points to a golden concoction on his
working table, -"I will need your assistance soon to wrap up this business with
my former associate. I will reach you with this."- Iosif hands Katrille a small
cytoplast sphere. -"Remember to apply the potion to the freshly deceased. It
will not work as expected to anything that died of natural causes or died more
than ten days ago."

...

Girls walked back to the Selesnya territories, this time avoiding Gruul and
walking a bit around through Vitu-Ghazi, the tree of life. As they came to
Wyn Zumro's hut, the sun was already approaching the edge of the skies.

--"You came back... I was sceptical at first. Did you find what you were looking for?"

--"Yes, where is Wataru?"- Nai asked Wyn.

--"Here, behind the hut",- Mister Zumro showed the way to a large tree with a enormous
bean-pod, -"Let me just...",- little bit of magic energy from Wyn's hand popped the pod
open.

Unsurprisingly inside a freshly preserved Wataru's corpse resided. Party selected Katrille to 
apply the golden potion on the deceased.
