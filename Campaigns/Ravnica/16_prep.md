# Intro

Mortimer is standing in his office, looking out through one of the large arched
windows. Morning sun is brightly illuminating spacious room, dust particles are
slowly dancing in the light. The party is anxiously standing, waiting for
Mortimer to speak.

"Given half of you have bounties on your heads, it is in your best interest to
help me resolve this issue.", Mortimer stated in firm voice.

Tall man moved back to his desk, picked up a newspaper.

"Your faces are on the second page."

Newspaper reads: "Conspiracy! Simic sabotage Golgary farms. Azorius custody
suite breached. Suspects at large!". Below the title four pictures are printed,
you recognize Linda, Wataru, Rozhe and Shinigami.

There is a bounty of 200 zinos for Linda and 10 zino bounty for others.

Below that, a subtitle reads: "Guildpact Chamber session planned for Azorsday!"

"We have three days to unravel this conspiracy. Since I am linked to Linda, I may
not pull my contacts from Azorius for help. We need to find someone indifferent,
but eager to take over the investigation from Tamid Luade. Any ideas?"

## Helper hooks

- Rozhe knows Eroan Ulatris, Azorius Hussar, partner of her passing father.
  Eroan, hearing about corrupt Azorius official, becomes interested in the
  investigation. He asks to find incriminating evidence on T.Luade.
- Tamid Luade can be tracked leaving the Lyev Column, or by other means
  somewhere around in Ravnica. He is accompanied by a [thought
  spy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/thought-spy). He lives in Griffin
  Heights, but visits Sixth Precinct on daily basis.
- Linda Moisuz can not be located using simple divination magic. However,
  players may find information around the city, if they find a reasonable
  approach to the situation.

## Dark lead
