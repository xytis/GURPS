# Intro
## Raising into the Gore House Arena

The ceiling opened up revealing a night sky above you. Platform raised slowly
as crowd parted together with moving metal plates under them. Stage next to the
platform was lit with numerous brazers and torches.

Shinigami landed on the stage after performing a blood freezing trick on the
suspended line above. Drums and trumpets silenced. A flute in Shinigami's
hands began playing a marching song. From far side of the stage two demons came
in carrying a pig adorned in Azorius uniform. They marched around full
perimeter of the stage. Pig looked at the small pale girl with black empty
eyes.

"An opening toast to the _authorities_", Shinigami raised her hand above the
pig. A scythe appeared and sliced down in a quick motion. Blood shot from the
cleaved head covering the pale girl.

Demons turned the pig around and squezed the lifeless corpse to gush out
another stream of warm blood on closest spectators. A cheer came from the
crowd.

"Enjoy yourselves and the spectacles that you are about to see", Shinigami
raised her hands and the music washed over the arena. Flames shot from the
edges of the scene. At least four acrobats jumped on the lines suspended
above the arena and jugled burning swords above the crowd.

Spikewheel acrobats came rolling through the crowd, lucky ones managed to move
out of the way, unlucky ones were rolled over. Their shouts drowned in the
loud music comming from all sides.

Platform stopped moving when it reached the scene.

Another wave of weird energy washed over the party. They felt burning
gazes from the crowd. They did not even notice when and who flung the first
flaming sword at them.

## Lovering down into the underpits

After at least 10 rounds (1 minute) the platform starts descending into the pits again.
After another 5 rounds no new creatures can get into the pit without fall damage.

After a total of 20 rounds the pit is back in safety.

Neirius lifts his head up. His hair is singed from the flames, there is a
bloody dagger in his hands. "We can leave. I am done."

A new mist of red energy is now orbiting the metalic flower, together with
black and green mist it forms a hypnotic pattern.

## Leaving the underpits

As the group starts moving out through the tunnels in the underpits
a lusty voice reaches their ears.

## Getting reward

They talked with Neirius and agreed on increased payment. They got 30 extra on top of initial 20.
