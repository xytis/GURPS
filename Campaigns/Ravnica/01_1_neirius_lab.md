# Scene 1: Neirius lab

You find the nearly crumbling building pressed between two larger structures.
You follow the steps to sub basement and see broken wooden door, helplessly
hanging from a bent hinge.

Behind you see a complete mess of a makeshift laboratory. Broken glass,
damaged, yet still buzzing Izzet machinery, papers scattered all around the
place. Obviously this place was stormed by Orzhov. You see signs of struggle
and a clear indication that something was dragged out from this laboratory.

Outside you find two orphan kids, a girl and a boy. They can give information
where the man was taken to. It is an Orzhov church just over the next block.

Apart from those two kids, no other clues about the location were your friend
was dragged can be found.

If party spends too much time and the night sets, a spirit approaches them. It
is a wailing spirit. It does not speak properly, but it manages to show the
path to Orzhov church by appearing on general direction of the church.

# Scene 2: Matilda's Shade

Orphanage in a large house with courtyard and a huge oak in the back. Kids are
playing in the yard, bigger kids are working around in the garden. You can feel
slight influence of Selesnia culture. Most probably matron is connected to that
guild.

Two orphan kids are from this orphanage. Their names are Jack and Mary. They
seems to be interested in whatever the adventurers have. They have seen the
human dragged into Orzhov church.
