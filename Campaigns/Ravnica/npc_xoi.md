# NPC: Xoi

Previously known as Xoiskulb, former Grull marauder. After encountering a life
threatening situation in a casual hunt and running away, he could no longer
return to his clan.

Xoi went and volunteered to join a group of goblin asistants for hire, who just
so happened had lost a member and were looking for a replacement.

He is muscular for a Izzet goblin, with large ears covered in holes from
earings, only one small mizzium earing remains in his left ear which signals
that he is part of The Mizzium Goblins hirelings. He is wearing simple textile
jumpsuit, his arms are covered in animal tatoos.
