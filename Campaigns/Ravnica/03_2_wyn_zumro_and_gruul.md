# Setup

To one member of the team Wyn opens up a little:

--"These are bad times for the forest. I see animals that are hunted away from
their habitat. I see trees that are striped bare from their life. I see Gruul
trying to destroy not only the civilization set in stone, but also civilization
grown in wood."- Zumro starts his monologue -"I asked rangers to patroll these areas,
but they are bound by the Guildpact, they will not approach Gruul clans and will not
talk with them, nor make them bow to the combined power of Selesnya."

He stops for a second and pours three cups of warm over bright yellow flower petals.

--"Since you asked me for shelter and a safe haven for your friend, I see only fair
you would do something about my forest."
