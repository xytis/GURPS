## Interlude with Neirius

Ah, what a day. Today you will perform in live show. Your skin is crawling with
excitement. You have been preparing for this show with your troupe members for
last two weeks. You will perform a splendid act and perhaps even spill some
blood in the name of Rakdos!

Ah, what a day it should have been. But it was by far not perfect. First, a
cage of cacklers broke loose, launching a premature panic among the crowd. Then
a Boros cleric exploded Beastmaster Gory's chest with some sort of powerbolt.
Then after the show had started Azorius officials appeared and began to
disperse the crowd do to "Equal something, section whichever". After I
protested I had been detained by a lawmage for "Disrupting the process of the
law". Then as my troupe teased the lawmage I got hit in the head pretty hard
and passed out in the street. When I woke up I was laying in the gutters, next
to a corpse of mutilated cackler. A Golgari reclaimer was poking a stick at me,
obviously unhappy that I woke up, he simply claimed the dead demon and returned
underground through an opening in the side of the alley. With my throbbing head
I stood up. Something fell out of my pocket. It was a letter. Stamped with
Izzet sign.

    Dear friend,
    Please meet me at my laboratory in The Blistercoils,
    between Sullemand's and Sunnix's before the sun sets tonight.
    I beg for your help, Neirius

***

As I rushed to Blistercoils the sun was already down. I had no clear
understanding what time it was. Long shadows extended creepily from the light
posts. I was not a "friend" to Neirius in any way. He was my supplier for fire
and lightning gadgets. It was simply a waste to let him go. I knew he was
working on something dangerous, but at this point I did not care. I wanted to
spill some blood. And decided that whatever problem is bugging Neirius, it
could bleed pretty well. I made a left turn towards Sunnix, and came to a
broken door leading to Neirius lab.

--"Be torched!",- I frustratingly proclaimed.

As I stepped towards the lab something caught my attention.

A loxodon running at full speed. Carrying a body. Human body.

He made a sharp turn and disappeared in the shadows.

Now this will be interesting. I moved to the shadows and started trailing the
'phant.


# Interlude Lost in Rubblebelt

Shinigami woke up with a dull pain in the side of her head. She looked around,
she was lying in filth, behind a pile of crates and broken barrels. It was
still dark, only with some light from distant stars and a ghastly torchlight
from nearby street. She got on her legs, still a bit shaking, and stumbled
forward into the alley. Trying to focus through the pain, she inspected the
dirt where Neirius was dropped, a lot of footprints around the place where she
fought the loxodon and a trail of feet leading out to the street. She stumbled
following the trail while she found herself in the brightly lit Tin Street. She
could only turn left or right. There was still some action in this street even
late at night. Prostitutes, shady looking dealers, goblin weapon merchants,
obviously pushing stolen goods, ... She approached one of the better looking
fellas, taped him on the shoulder:

--"Would you happened to have seen a loxodon carrying a body?"- she asked
slowly jiggling a coin between her fingers.

--"Why what a pretty face for such dark night... Awww, did the elephant did
something to you?"- his voice raised a few octaves, to a nurturing tone, when
he saw blood on the side of her face, -"Did the big bad 'phant hurt this..."-
his voice cracked and halted as he fell a chilling grasp around his neck.

--"If you value your tongue, you will use it for speaking carefully."-
shinigami hissed.

--"They ran past, in a hurry, about four hours ago. They looked concerned and
went into Gruul territory few blocks north of here. That's all I know..."- the
man dropped the tough act in an instant and was now like a soft wool in her
grasp.

--"Good boy. Now run along..."- she smirked at the man, and pressed a coin into
his sweaty palm.

Shinigami followed into the Rubblebelt, still seeing some faint tracks through
thickening vegetation. But few hours later, the tracks have disappeared and
Rakdos performer wandered helplessly around hostile Gruul jungle.

She picked up her flute and played a travel tune which kept her company while
the sun was slowly rising above the horizon. Suddenly she heard a commotion
behind a ruined chapel:

--"Duun huun daagaan?"- something shouted. -"Taash or daan mech o!"

--"Wis'd zlyxuk. Xy likx as jxulx."- she replied in Abbysal, having no idea
what was told to her.

--"Draalkuuc? Khruun, khruun, khruun draalkuuc!"- another phrase echoed from
the large broken walls.

Three goblins appeared from behind the corner:

--"Where you go? What you do?"

--"I am looking for my friends. Where could I find them?"- she menacingly
looked at the little creatures, -"You might stay alive if you tell me."

They shivered a bit. They had just saved their hides from angry loxodon and his
party in the forests of Selesnya, they had no intention to die here. Also the
girl seemed extremely determined to kill them where they stand.

--"Your friends, big elephant and blue girl?"- one of the goblins asked.

--"Those two stole my friend, so I am trying to track them."- Shinigami
replied.

--"We want do nothing with them. They kill Breegork. They go south."- smallest
of the trio barked in accented common tongue.

--"Lead me where they killed Breegork."- she pressed the goblins on, swinging
her scythe around.

--"No hurt us Draalkuuc, we show."- goblins just turned around and scampered
back into dark woods behind the ruins, leaving Rakdos performer no other choice
but to follow them.

After around an hour of walking through forest, they ended up in small
clearing, where obvious signs of combat were still present. Along with a dead
half-ogre and a goblin. Three goblins checked their chieftains body for life
and scavenged through his pockets, barked a few words among them and checked
fallen goblins body too. Taking his spear, tooth necklace and something from
his pouch.

--"You have done your job, now scramble."- Shinigami ordered watching as
goblins scavenged through their fallen comrades.

--"Rhor ac maach!"- they barked and scrambled away from the angry looking girl.

Shinigami investigated the bodies of Breegork and the goblin. Found a piece of
jerky in the undergarment of the ogre. Driven by her desire to mutilate and
perform art, she sliced the side of the corpse and used the ogre intestines to
create a depiction of Rakdos sign. Then she stabbed the sign with a dagger,
leaving a bloody mark on the skull of Rakdos.

After investigating the area she found three pairs of tracks: heavy 'phant
stomps, some humanoid feet in the moss and blood next to large animal footprints.

She followed the tracks for about an hour and ended up on an edge of the forest.
A livewood hut surrounded by activity in early morning light stood in her sight.
Young Selesnyan elves and humans were walking around the hut, taking care
of plants in the garden and feeding injured animals. A short black haired elf
was nurturing a heavily injured dire wolf.

Shinigami retreated into the forest and started mimicking nature sounds with her
flute. After she played for a while she hid among the thick foliage and started
gnawing on the dried meat she found on the ogre earlier.

She watched the hut closely for a couple of hours, and noticed a group of
ranger elves who appeared out of nowhere at the edge of the forest. They
walked up to an elderly dark haired elf, spoke for a while and disappeared back
in the thickness of the forest.

Feeling well hidden she decides to take a well deserved rest.
