# Backstory

After being repeatedly abused by her own father, once silent and obedient girl
snapped. One day, when her father was advancing on her, she grabbed a nearby
mace and knocked the old man out. She did not stop there, as if something
bloodthirsty had awakened in her. She took out her fathers carpentry kit and
bolted the old man to the floor. She ripped his cock and slammed it deep into
his crying mouth, forcing it down with a wooden spike. Then she collapsed in
the puddle of blood and laughed with bloodthirsty delight.

That was how her mother, Catrina, found her. Curled up to a mutilated dead
man's corpse, with her clothes ripped off, covered in blood head to toe.

The girl barely spoke about what happened, she could not stop crying and
Catrina, not knowing about any of the nasty and vile things father was doing
with their daughter, assumed that some sort of demonic force was involved with
her family. She contacted Orzhov and got her husband buried and her child
blessed by the pontiff.

Few days after her father incident she came across a beggar playing a banged up
flute. The sharp notes resonated with the girls soul so she sat down on the
ground next to the dirty toothless man. Catrina could not persuade the girl to
leave that place on any other condition, than by buying off the flute from the
beggar. From that day onward, the girl and the flute would be inseparable.

Few years later Catrina found herself a new man - a local mason. Jakson
appeared decent at first, but later on his crippling alcoholism surfaced.
Countless times Jakson and Catrina got into fights over the girls music. To
Jakson, the music was creepy and borderline insane, to Catrina, it was the only
thing that placed a smile on her beloved daughters face. One faithful night,
Jakson returned home wasted. He barged into the room and found the girl playing
her flute with her bare teenage legs crossed on a warm fur. He licked his dry
lips and imagined all the nasty things he wants to do to the girl. He swirled
forward and ripped the flute out of her young lips. The old flute snapped in
his palm. He tossed the shards away and pushed the girl down on the fur with
his drunken body. She screamed and scratched at his strong arms to no avail. He
leaned back to unfasten his pants. Last thing he saw was a demonic flame
burning in girls eyes as she leaped forward and gouged his eyes with her bare
fingers.

Next morning Catrina came back home from her night shift and found her man
crucified on the kitchen wall upside down... His arms and legs were fasten
using kitchen tools, intestines were all over the place, genitalia were ripped
off and forced into stepfathers throat. His cut belly was full of paper notes
"It's all his fault". The girl was missing.

Living as a stray dog in harsh streets of Ravnica the girl succumbed to
murderous rage and feasting on the flesh of the dead. She was a natural in the
ways of inflicting pain and suffering no one could imagine. One day The Rakdos
himself stumbled on her in his demonic dreams. She was torturing a pontiff of
Orzhov, his screams and prayers managed to breach the demon's conciousness and
peak his interest. The lord of defiling found amusement and artistry in her
work, so he decided to shelter the promising girl. Through the hands of current
Bloodwitch, he entrusted the girl with gift of dark arts and she devoted her
life to him by making a blood sealed pact. Rakdos named her Loviatar, after the
godly mistress of physical and psychological pain and torture.

The girl is finally at peace with her desires, she is two sided as Rakdos
himself, happy to entertain others by playing her flute anywhere and anytime
she wants, or indulging in pain of others when she sees fit.

## Inner demons that have pointy horns

1. Since my mother was secretly visiting Rakdos trying to find my because she
   had a suspicion I might be there, and I was secretly stalking her at nights
   though the window of our small house, leaving some money by the door step
   whenever I had a penny or two, one day my old house became empty. No more
   lights at night, no more tasty supper smells in the evening. Nothing. After
   a month I tried to break into my house and found nothing but the cobwebs. It
   seemed like there was no life inside at least for a year. Was Rakdos himself
   was playing my mind to give some "meaning" to my pathetic life? Or maybe I
   actually had a mother and my whole story is true but Rakdos himself or
   someone high ranked killed her?

2. I've been bullied a lot. Especially by a Rakdos Witch - Karnataka. She
   always whispered me some bullshit about a woman by the entrance looking for
   a lost daughter, few times I ran outside but there was nothing but the dead
   homeless with his insides all around ( that was my art, ha ha). Anyway,
   Rakdos has dozens of girls. All of them has a similar story to mine. I
   wonder can it be some how related?

0. Žodžiu, mano char pagrindinis tikslas yra išsiaiškinti kas iš tiesų nutiko
   su jos motina - ar tai tai buvo tik iliuzija sukurta Rakdos, ar motina iš
   tiesų egzistavo, bet dėl kažkokių kerų, mergaitei buvo susuktos smegenys ir
   dėl to ji užpjovė savo tėvą, bei patėvį, nors iš tiesų jie nieko blogo
   nedarė (a. k. a. Rakdos tokiu būdu supisa jaunoms mergaitėms psichiką ir
   tuomet užverbuoja jas pas save į klaną), ar viskas kas vyko buvo realu. It's
   up to you to decide which one is more interesting and suitable.

## Interlude with Neirius

Ah, what a day. Today you will perform in live show. Your skin is crawling with
excitement. You have been preparing for this show with your troupe members for
last two weeks. You will perform a splendid act and perhaps even spill some
blood in the name of Rakdos!

Ah, what a day it should have been. But it was by far not perfect. First, a
cage of cacklers broke loose, launching a premature panic among the crowd. Then
a Boros cleric exploded Beastmaster Gory's chest with some sort of powerbolt.
Then after the show had started Azorius officials appeared and began to
disperse the crowd do to "Equal something, section whichever". After I
protested I had been detained by a lawmage for "Disrupting the process of the
law". Then as my troupe teased the lawmage I got hit in the head pretty hard
and passed out in the street. When I woke up I was laying in the gutters, next
to a corpse of mutilated cackler. A Golgari reclaimer was poking a stick at me,
obviously unhappy that I woke up, he simply claimed the dead demon and returned
underground through an opening in the side of the alley. With my throbbing head
I stood up. Something fell out of my pocket. It was a letter. Stamped with
Izzet sign.

    Dear friend,
    Please meet me at my laboratory in The Blistercoils,
    between Sullemand's and Sunnix's before the sun sets tonight.
    I beg for your help, Neirius

***

As I rushed to Blistercoils the sun was already down. I had no clear
understanding what time it was. Long shadows extended creepily from the light
posts. I was not a "friend" to Neirius in any way. He was my supplier for fire
and lightning gadgets. It was simply a waste to let him go. I knew he was
working on something dangerous, but at this point I did not care. I wanted to
spill some blood. And decided that whatever problem is bugging Neirius, it
could bleed pretty well. I made a left turn towards Sunnix, and came to a
broken door leading to Neirius lab.

--"Be torched!",- I frustratingly proclaimed.

As I stepped towards the lab something caught my attention.

A loxodon running at full speed. Carrying a body. Human body.

He made a sharp turn and disappeared in the shadows.

Now this will be interesting. I moved to the shadows and started trailing the
'phant.


# Interlude Lost in Rubblebelt

Shinigami woke up with a dull pain in the side of her head. She looked around,
she was lying in filth, behind a pile of crates and broken barrels. It was
still dark, only with some light from distant stars and a ghastly torchlight
from nearby street. She got on her legs, still a bit shaking, and stumbled
forward into the alley. Trying to focus through the pain, she inspected the
dirt where Neirius was dropped, a lot of footprints around the place where she
fought the loxodon and a trail of feet leading out to the street. She stumbled
following the trail while she found herself in the brightly lit Tin Street. She
could only turn left or right. There was still some action in this street even
late at night. Prostitutes, shady looking dealers, goblin weapon merchants,
obviously pushing stolen goods, ... She approached one of the better looking
fellas, taped him on the shoulder:

--"Would you happened to have seen a loxodon carrying a body?"- she asked
slowly jiggling a coin between her fingers.

--"Why what a pretty face for such dark night... Awww, did the elephant did
something to you?"- his voice raised a few octaves, to a nurturing tone, when
he saw blood on the side of her face, -"Did the big bad 'phant hurt this..."-
his voice cracked and halted as he fell a chilling grasp around his neck.

--"If you value your tongue, you will use it for speaking carefully."-
shinigami hissed.

--"They ran past, in a hurry, about four hours ago. They looked concerned and
went into Gruul territory few blocks north of here. That's all I know..."- the
man dropped the tough act in an instant and was now like a soft wool in her
grasp.

--"Good boy. Now run along..."- she smirked at the man, and pressed a coin into
his sweaty palm.

Shinigami followed into the Rubblebelt, still seeing some faint tracks through
thickening vegetation. But few hours later, the tracks have disappeared and
Rakdos performer wandered helplessly around hostile Gruul jungle.

She picked up her flute and played a travel tune which kept her company while
the sun was slowly rising above the horizon. Suddenly she heard a commotion
behind a ruined chapel:

--"Duun huun daagaan?"- something shouted. -"Taash or daan mech o!"

--"Wis'd zlyxuk. Xy likx as jxulx."- she replied in Abbysal, having no idea
what was told to her.

--"Draalkuuc? Khruun, khruun, khruun draalkuuc!"- another phrase echoed from
the large broken walls.

Three goblins appeared from behind the corner:

--"Where you go? What you do?"

--"I am looking for my friends. Where could I find them?"- she menacingly
looked at the little creatures, -"You might stay alive if you tell me."

They shivered a bit. They had just saved their hides from angry loxodon and his
party in the forests of Selesnya, they had no intention to die here. Also the
girl seemed extremely determined to kill them where they stand.

--"Your friends, big elephant and blue girl?"- one of the goblins asked.

--"Those two stole my friend, so I am trying to track them."- Shinigami
replied.

--"We want do nothing with them. They kill Breegork. They go south."- smallest
of the trio barked in accented common tongue.

--"Lead me where they killed Breegork."- she pressed the goblins on, swinging
her scythe around.

--"No hurt us Draalkuuc, we show."- goblins just turned around and scampered
back into dark woods behind the ruins, leaving Rakdos performer no other choice
but to follow them.

After around an hour of walking through forest, they ended up in small
clearing, where obvious signs of combat were still present. Along with a dead
half-ogre and a goblin. Three goblins checked their chieftains body for life
and scavenged through his pockets, barked a few words among them and checked
fallen goblins body too. Taking his spear, tooth necklace and something from
his pouch.

--"You have done your job, now scramble."- Shinigami ordered watching as
goblins scavenged through their fallen comrades.

--"Rhor ac maach!"- they barked and scrambled away from the angry looking girl.

Shinigami investigated the bodies of Breegork and the goblin. Found a piece of
jerky in the undergarment of the ogre. Driven by her desire to mutilate and
perform art, she sliced the side of the corpse and used the ogre intestines to
create a depiction of Rakdos sign. Then she stabbed the sign with a dagger,
leaving a bloody mark on the skull of Rakdos.

After investigating the area she found three pairs of tracks: heavy 'phant
stomps, some humanoid feet in the moss and blood next to large animal footprints.

She followed the tracks for about an hour and ended up on an edge of the forest.
A livewood hut surrounded by activity in early morning light stood in her sight.
Young Selesnyan elves and humans were walking around the hut, taking care
of plants in the garden and feeding injured animals. A short black haired elf
was nurturing a heavily injured dire wolf.

Shinigami retreated into the forest and started mimicking nature sounds with her
flute. After she played for a while she hid among the thick foliage and started
gnawing on the dried meat she found on the ogre earlier.

She watched the hut closely for a couple of hours, and noticed a group of
ranger elves who appeared out of nowhere at the edge of the forest. They
walked up to an elderly dark haired elf, spoke for a while and disappeared back
in the thickness of the forest.

Feeling well hidden she decides to take a well deserved rest.

# Dream cycle

## The beginning

You open your eyes. You are sitting in a bright kitchen. Windows open up to a
beautiful city scape of Ravnica, blue domes and spires as far as eye can see. A
gorgeous long straight black haired woman with pale skin is holding out a spoon
with some porridge in it. You turn your gaze, a man sits next to you. His
shoulders are broad, he has a wide bright smile, his white hair is trimmed
shortly, his skin is light brown. His muscular hands are holding a small plush
bear. Your tiny arms extend towards the bear, you hug it. You lift your gaze
back up, you are sitting on the floor. Woman is sitting next to a window and is
playing with a flute. Her eyes are closed and her head is slightly tilted. The
music is soft and dreamy. You get on all fours and crawl under a table. You
turn around. White light changed to red tint. There is a pool of blood in the
middle of the room. On the left, a headless corpse wearing a blood soaked white
dress sits with back pressed to a wall. There is a huge smear of blood above it
on light paint. You watch high heeled red leather boots with black buckles walk
slowly in front of you. A thud. A womans head with two gouged eyes drops in
front of you. You wake up. Your scythe is in both hands, your arms are slightly
trembling. You hear a low growl in your head. You make out a single word in
Abyssal "child" then the growling fades into morning chill.

Explanation: A Rakdos assassin was sent to kill the wife of Arthur Nirthagan.
He had stepped over few unhappy heads in Orzhov by seizing and stopping a
lucrative human trafficking operation. When he returned home that evening, he
found his wife beheaded and his daughter gone. He quit Azorius the very next
day and became infamously known as The Blue Exile. He hunted down Rakdos
assassins and slayed them with his mighty two handed sword. He was slain in a
duel by the Massacre Girl. It is unknown if he ever found the assassin that
killed his wife.

## The witch

You are sitting in a bright room under a table. You are playing with a plush
bear. You wiggle his arms as if he wants to hug you, you lift him up for an
embrace. Music is playing somewhere in the distance. Suddenly it stops.
Everything turns red. A decapitated female's head with both eyes gouged fills
the view. It's lips start moving but you hear no voice. Pale skin morphs into
red scarred flesh, black straight hair spins into braids, then curves up and
becomes a pair of horns. Black shiny eyes reflect fire from no longer empty
sockets. World around you is shaking. You hear a voice, low and growling. You
do not understand what it says. World goes dark and cold, you feel your cheeks
freezing. There are stars far away in the darkness. A door opens. You see your
mom. She picks you up and brushes your hair from your face. You feel tears
flowing down your cheeks. You wake up, your face is wet with tears. You hear
the familiar low growl that keeps you company for a while now. Abyssal words
are slowly repeated "closer, closer, closer" you feel inner heat build up in
your chest.

Explanation: Demon accompanying the assassin was given the child to dispose of.
Instead he left the child at a random door, where Catrina and Ricardo lived.
They took the small girl in and never told her about her this.

## The push

You are sitting in a dimly lit room. You hear door slam open and a large figure
stumbling into the room. You hear a voice, you feel lust and anger in it, but
you can't make out what does it say. You are sitting with your back turned to
him. You dare not to look. You stare blankly into the wall in front. He touches
your hair. You shiver, your body tenses up. He whispers something to your ear.
You shake your head. He stands back up. Thud. You feel a dull pain in your back
and head. Groves on wooden planks begin to shift and twist. Shapes start
forming in front of your eyes. World shifts and turns crimson. You feel
something painfully forcing into you. Darkness. You wake up curled up into a
ball. Memory of pain makes you sob and tears are flowing down your cheeks. You
are lying on a wooden floor. You look at the shifting grooves in the planks.
You raise yourself against the cold ground. You hear a voice in your head.
"Feed it to him". You look around the room. A hot feeling blazes inside you.
"Feed it to him". You take a club and brush your pale fingers against the metal
rod. Feeling of warm fire engulfs your cold hands. You wake up. Your palms are
burning hot. You look at them, there are two small flames coming out from them.
A clear demonic voice in your head says "performer".

Explanation: Hatred possessed the broken girl and she took justice in her own
hands. Read initial backstory for details.
