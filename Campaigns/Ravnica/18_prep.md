# Overaching stuff

Mr. Spasov on behalf of Nai(Najwa) performed some swooping around. He traced
the incident with Orzhov Book of Souls back to human cutthroat called Bertan.
(see [[16_prep#Dark lead]])

Bertan is not affiliated with Cell that works under Stelian Szabolcs. He is not
aware about the internals of what is going on with Tamid Luade. From his
perspective he has failed to discreetly close unoficial Izzet research and has
reported that to his Cell. He has lost the tampered Book of Souls, for that he was
suspended from active action. He now tries to make a living in the Bane Alley.

If by any means he could gain favor from another Cell, he would go for it. But
he has to be approached by the other Cell first.

Meanwhile Stelian escaped with his life at the line. He was aiming to dispose
of the inconspicous adventurers and mindwash them before the hearing in ithe
Chamber of the Guildpact. Now he plans for a more subtle approach. Tamid was
severly injured and required immediate assistance. Tamid reported the injury
over the official Azorius channels, thus raising the bounty on all party
members. Tamid used the handwritten message to display his innocence.

Stelian obtained bodies of three Azorius guards, who by forgery, had assisted
Tamid during the 'raid' on the party's whereabouts. Along with those guards,
Eroan was killed. His body is taken over by a changeling, along with his
possition. Changeling has a callsign which is used to adress him instead of
his shape: "Abandoned Lakeside". Changeling also is fluent in thieveskant.

Stelian planted the Azorius guards in the rented laboratory. They will be
used as evidence against the party.

Stelian now has disbanded his Cell, in order to find a more suitable base of
operations. He works as Tamid and A. Lakeside contact. His idea is
to stay low until his plan nourishes. Once Tamid receives a promotion he will
move to next assigmnent.

Eroan was killed together with his three friends while he was discovered digging
into Tamid. A lower level associate working under Tamid lured them out with false
pretence of having compromising information on Tamid. He then handed the reigns to
A. Lakeside, who cleaned the situation.

Eroans body can be found in the Forge District, in one of the recently destroyed
blocks. His body is devoid of personal items, it is enacted as if he was killed
by a falling ceiling.

Dimir has a strong foothold in Azorius, and rooting it all out would require
some strong assistance, most probably from outside of the guild.

# NPC: Bertan (Dimir operative)

(stats)[https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/assassin]

Young (approx 22 y.o.) human male. Has short black hair, angry looking
demeanor, silver peercings in his ears. He was born outside of Tenth District
and came here as a stoveaway in one of the merchant barges.

He started his life in the city by using his swiftness in stealing and
steadiness in dealing the killing blows. He was soon noticed by Bane Alley
recruiters and involved in bigger gigs. Eventualy he was assigned as a
spy-assasin to Razlas Mozgos Cell.

His goal is to find his way into the ranks of Orzhov and assasinate the family
of Larted Zon. His home was torn down by bandits, his sister was slaughtered
along with his parents and elder brothers. From what he has gathered, the order
was given out by Larted Zon, an elderly Orzhov Pontif, who was trying to buy
out Bertan's home to build a remote church for his nephew. The negotiation
turned sour when Bertan's father, who had inherited the land from his father,
forcefully rejected initial Zon's proposal. After a few months of scares and
visits from Orzhov enforcers, during which Bertan's family continued to reject
to sign a deal which promised protection from external sources, a group of
bandits came. They killed on sight and took whatever they could.

After Bertan's family was killed, all neighbouring families gave in. And
Bertan's home was simply abducted on pretence that no living members of his
family are there to claim the land.

Bertan fled the town soon after, seeking work and shelter in Tenth District.

Bertan can be hooked into talking by mentioning Mortimer Lan's name. As Lan
family is closely bound to Zon family.

Bertan is able to propose a deal, where he asks for pact bound favour from
Mortimer Lan in exchange for his service regarding Neirius.

# Bane Alley

[Flavour](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/ravnica-campaign-setting/images/6/65/Sf213_kalvglfvjl.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/620?cb=20121214013044)

You enter a narrow stairway leading down from an alley behind a seared meat
stand. Stairs open up to a enourmous ancient archway that is build under the
promenade that you were in just moments ago. As you descend you see mostly
cloaked crowd walking between roofed stands built along the walls of the
archway.

As you step into the crowd you feel eyes locked uppon you. And not only locked.
At least two figures are actively following you without even trying to hide
their intentions.

# Intro

Party stands in close circle around a kneeling woman, she is sobbing uncontrollably.

## Gob, the lost

Gob follows the party at a safe distance. He must make stealth rolls against passive perceptions
at every transition (+0).

He carries a note from Neirius:

    Friends,

    Angel Sarakiel has shown great interest in my research. This is
    neither good news neither terrible. I will be conducting next
    part of my research under direct supervision by the named angel.

    I would greatly appreciate your participation. Azorsday, 15th of Mokosh,
    before dawn, my laboratory.

    P.S. Sullemand was looking for you.

Gob can explain he is still confused by the bar he used to own. At least in his mind.
He will try to return to Mizzium Brothers, maybe he will find some clarity there.

He also notes that his name most probably is not Gob. But he is not sure about that.
