# Hooks, secrets and rumors

Azorius lawmages had outlawed using Succubi as attraction for upcoming
festival. There are posters all around town that anyone who will enjoy a
Succubi will be prosecuted by Law of Indignity. This has raised a lot of
dissatisfaction among the people who were waiting for the next Rakdos festival.

Oathkeeper Emporium is busting full tonight. First fights of Orzhov tournament
are taking place.

Third victim fell dead to the wet assassin. A courier boy from Izmeri library.
His name or connection to other two victims is unknown. [PLOT HOOK: First

issued open bounty on the "Wet slayer of Blistercoils". Current bounty is 15
zinos.

A large group of people are marching to protest near the Seventh Zonot. They
are shouting something about "The Gift of Life". Azorius and Boros are trying
to peacefully disperse the crowd.
  There are 7 entrances to the zonot and all of them are crowded by cultists.
  Each street-head is closed off by Boros.

Waspcrabs are still at large. They come in large swarms at night and buzz above
the Golgari rotfarms.

Goblin raiders had been seen riding through The Foundry Street. Some say Gruul
became involved with local thugs in The Foundry Street.

A group of spirits had broken free from Orzhov Basilica during an earthquake
and a collapse in Whitestone. Investigation is on the way by Wojek Tiernan
Dunphy.

# Locations

## Slashed Rose tavern

A shack with semi broken tavern sign. You are greeted by a small sharp eared
goblin.

## The Oathkeeper Emporium

Conveniently built on intersection between the Blistercoils, the Bulwark and
the Smelting quarter. This place is bustling most of the time, filled with
after work Boros legionnaires, passing through Gruul demolishers, scientists
from Izzet and Simmic, and a whole lot of Orzhov higher members, who come here
for good food and a fine show. You can always find someone who is interested in
a bet on the next fight or a quarrel for one. Cutthroats and enforcers are kept
at relative peace outside the arena, as one of the house rule states that
fighting without a proper betting round is heavily punished by Orzhov
overlords.

Dark stone building, with a curved facade decorated in pillars. There is a
large porthole to allow unrestricted entry through dark wood gate. On the sides
of main passageway there are two small doors, used by security and other
personnel. There is an alley leading around the building and separating it from
every other structure in the vicinity. Above the alley some fancier buildings
have stone and glass bridges connecting them with upper floors of the arena.
You can stop and observe various statues in the arches throughout the curving
wall. Most of the statues depict previous champions of the arena. Large ogres,
human sized shapes and tiny goblins stand in stone with their weapons of choice
raised to the outside world.

Inside a maze of tunnels and stairs lead to the small podiums built from the
same stone, housing one or more tables, overlooking the arena. There are more
private rooms that open up tho the main arena, mostly used by the wealthy.
Below the bloody arena a series of chambers lie. In there fighters prepare for
combat. Even below that a huge kitchen is located, with passageways through the
Undercity to Golgari and Rakdos territories. Both of those are necessary allies
when providing food and organising daily fights and performances.

When no fights are organised the Emporium serves as imp controlled restaurant.

## The Quicksilver Bat Bridge over The Death Chasm

The lowest of the three bridges that are still outside Golgari territory that
connect The Blistercoils with The Bulwark. A good spot to get someone killed
without a trace. Also a good spot to have someone listen to you with utmost
attention, because of the first reason this bridge is famous for. Both ends
disappear in a maze of underground passages that sprout under every building in
Ravnica.

It got the name from an incident few hundred years back when a scientist tried
to ship a significant load of said metal to the foundry using the shortest and
least inspected path. Obviously the Quicksliver was "liberated" from a rival
laboratory and was meant to be forged into a golem. By sheer accident a pack of
Bloodhunter Bats had chosen this bridge as their resting place and attacked the
caravan. In the end the quicksilver was spilled all over the pavement and
dripped down on remaining hanging bats. Now those bats are permanently encased
in magical shimmering casing, which repels most of wildlife from coming
anywhere close.
