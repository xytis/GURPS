## Rising back to Tin Street

As you follow mouldy steps back to the surface evening heat hits your face. The
market is crowded as always, with people hustling in the crowd and browsing
through the goods laid out on the numerous counters through the length of this
cobblestoned street. In the middle Rakdos trio are doing a small acrobatics
number, with two spikewheels and a blade dancer performing blood-freezing
tricks.

You hear soft thumps like a large drum coming closer with every beat. You look
above the crowd, a large creature with horizontal horns that could
tear through any of the stalls is slowly moving forward with something heavy on
it's back.  Two beastmasters are guiding the creature through bussy street,
shouting for everyone to give way.

## Entering The Oathkeeper Emporium

Oathkeeper Emporium is bustling with people tonight. A small line of two humans
with a female demon, few devcarin with a handful of kraul and an ogre stand in
front of the entrance. They are rather quickly let in and go through different
paths inside.

Greeted by an imp with a bright red tie with grey stripes. He is standing
behind a table with a list of entries and a metal box with an open lock on it.
Standing ehing him, a large ogre in black plate adorments is leaning on a
greataxe.

"Hello and welcome to The Oathkeeper Emporium! What will be your choice
tonight? You came to watch or to fight?"

"If I may suggest you the best seats in the third floor, 15 zinos each, plus
any refreshments that you partake."

"If you wish to spare some coin, you can get get a table on the second floor,
that will be 5 zinos per table, plus anything you order."

"It's a shame you can't spare some coin for fabulous entertainment, but fret
not, only five zibs each and you can watch the fight from the ground floor."

## The Oathkeeper, leaving with your hides

After the fight, if J'okhana wins, same thugs as previously ambush the party
and try to reason at least half of their money back. They reason that she
is part of the group and all of them raised money to bet on her.
Thugs are as follows:
 - Borek (11 AC, 1d8+2 slashing)
 - Nikolas (13 AC, 1d6+2 slashing) (two human brothers, have fresh scars on their bodies. One holds a longsword and another a shortsword and a buckler.)
 - Steve (13 AC, 1d4+2 bludgeoning) (A blond medium sized human, has a fine shield in his hands and a club)
 - Arkady (11 AC, 1d8+2 bludgeoning) (Larger male, simple face, slightly wide eyes. Looks a bit to both sides. Has a huge club)
 - Sozox (11 AC, 1d6+2 piercing) (Goblin with a wide gap between his front teeth. Most probably few are missing from a fight. Has a spear.)
 - Lucas (11 AC, 1d6+2 bludgeoning/1d8 piercing) (Slim and pale human with dark hair, has a mace and a crossbow)

# Locations

## Church of All Gifts

Three white arcs stand a bit further down the road. Trees and wines surround the
road and cast a warm shadow on the smooth cobblestones. Two large trees grow and
nearly merge with the white arcs. Wines and other plants crawl up the stone and
reemoves the strict boundary between man made structures and nature. A simple
grass opening with stone benches circling a round altas lie behind the entrance.
Large trees cast rays of light through foliage.

## The Oathkeeper Emporium

Conveniently built on intersection between the Blistercoils, the Bulwark and
the Smelting quarter. This place is bustling most of the time, filled with
after work Boros legionnaires, passing through Gruul demolishers, scientists
from Izzet and Simmic, and a whole lot of Orzhov higher members, who come here
for good food and a fine show. You can always find someone who is interested in
a bet on the next fight or a quarrel for one. Cutthroats and enforcers are kept
at relative peace outside the arena, as one of the house rule states that
fighting without a proper betting round is heavily punished by Orzhov
overlords.

Dark stone building, with a curved facade decorated in pillars. There is a
large porthole to allow unrestricted entry through dark wood gate. On the sides
of main passageway there are two small doors, used by security and other
personnel. There is an alley leading around the building and separating it from
every other structure in the vicinity. Above the alley some fancier buildings
have stone and glass bridges connecting them with upper floors of the arena.
You can stop and observe various statues in the arches throughout the curving
wall. Most of the statues depict previous champions of the arena. Large ogres,
human sized shapes and tiny goblins stand in stone with their weapons of choice
raised to the outside world.

Inside a maze of tunnels and stairs lead to the small podiums built from the
same stone, housing one or more tables, overlooking the arena. There are more
private rooms that open up tho the main arena, mostly used by the wealthy.
Below the bloody arena a series of chambers lie. In there fighters prepare for
combat. Even below that a huge kitchen is located, with passageways through the
Undercity to Golgari and Rakdos territories. Both of those are necessary allies
when providing food and organising daily fights and performances.

When no fights are organised the Emporium serves as imp controlled restaurant.

An old hag is selling carpets in the Tin Street. I've heard her clients have
ended up dead if they threated her poorly and others found gemstones on their
new carpets if they were pleasant.
