## Rising back to Tin Street

As you follow mouldy steps back to the surface evening heat hits your face. The
market is crowded as always, with people hustling in the crowd and browsing
through the goods laid out on the numerous counters through the length of this
cobblestoned street. In the middle Rakdos trio are doing a small acrobatics
number, with two spikewheels and a blade dancer performing blood-freezing
tricks.

You hear soft thumps like a large drum coming closer with every beat. You look
above the crowd, a large creature with horizontal horns that could tear through
any of the stalls is slowly moving forward with something heavy on it's back.
Two beastmasters are guiding the creature through bussy street, shouting for
everyone to give way.

What are you going to do?

## Church of All Gifts

Three white arcs stand a bit further down the road. Trees and wines surround the
road and cast a warm shadow on the smooth cobblestones. Two large trees grow and
nearly merge with the white arcs. Wines and other plants crawl up the stone and
reemoves the strict boundary between man made structures and nature. A simple
grass opening with stone benches circling a round altas lie behind the entrance.
Large trees cast rays of light through foliage.

# Hooks

An old hag is selling carpets in the Tin Street. I've heard her clients have
ended up dead if they threated her poorly and others found gemstones on their
new carpets if they were pleasant.
