# Inn: Rainbucket Inn

Simple stone building on the corner of two streets. A bottomless bucket is
hanging above the door. Letters on the bucket read "RAIN BUCKET".

Wooden door lead into a simple rectangular room. There is a couple of tables
and a fireplace on one end. The furniture is old but not too shabby. Door behind
the bar leads to the kitchen. It is well furnished with utensils and is relatively
clean. From the main room a small staircase leads to upper floor. There is one
room in the second floor and a door to personal innkeeper chambers. Windows
open to the street. There is a row of two story bunk beds and a chest at every
bed along the longest wall.

Innkeeper: Short thin human. Has short black hair and a neatly cut short beard.
His black eyes are set deeply in his skull.

Samuel Gordon is keeping the place clean and neat. He welcomes travelers and
poor merchants. His inn always has free place to stay when Autumn rains start
pouring in Ravnica.

There is not much of fine liquor or extravagant wines. But Samuel knows how to
brew his own beer and makes a fine porrage. Unfortunately he struggles to cook
anything else.

Sometimes a girl named Lucy comes over and helps with food. Locals make fun of
Samuel, that he should marry her just to keep the customers fed.
