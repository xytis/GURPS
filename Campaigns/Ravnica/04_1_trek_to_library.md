## NPC Iosif

Vedalken, of really old age, his wrinkles are covering otherwise smooth face.
His hands are slightly trembling, but he shows unprecedented wisdom and
awareness. Sometimes even in the borderline of psychic powers.

# Setup

The party goes out to resurrect one of their fallen friends. They ask about and
obtain the knowledge that a potion of resurrection can be made with the help of
Simic Biochemist.

They delve deep into Zonot Seven to find the Biochemist Iosif.

They are greeted by a large underwater basin next to breeding chambers, filled
with various species, collected from both underwater and above. Behind many
huge glass containers, there is a small corridor, which leads to a blackened
metal door.

--"What brings you to the exalted laboratory of Biochemist Iosif?"- a wrinkled
vedalken greets the party.

...

Suddenly great ruckus starts outside the door. If party investigates they are
attacked by released Simic experiments.

Specimen #74: [Flying] [Amorphous Structure]

  Flying blob of various colors, steadily shifting among the shapeless
  carapace. It appears to have some sort of skin, but no distinguishable
  appendages. A wurm like mouth is placed in front of the creature, no visible
  eyes.

Specimen #113: [Regeneration] [Stabilizing Legs]

  A five legged muscle patch, with a bird like beak menacing on a strong neck.
  Two eyes are placed on either side of the beak, forcing the head to tilt from
  side to side in order to see properly. Legs are boneless, slurping around but
  have sharp looking claws at the end of each.

Specimen #7: [Hypnotic Display] [Cryptic Skin]

  A rodent like creature, with bald chameleon skin and five skinny tails, has
  small lizard like head and drake like legs.

Specimen #67: [Armored Hide] [Leaping Legs]

  Frog and crab hibrid, with two strong claws, chitinous skin and muscular back
  legs. It's black bead eyes are standing on small antenna.

Specimen N-11: [Aquatic] [Heightened Awareness] [Bioluminescent Markings]

  A four legged shark like creature, with multiple eyes on flexible stems and a
  strong jaw. It's scales are covered in colorful markings which glow in the
  dark.

Iosif jumps through the door, gasps in anger, his all creations are running
amok. He notices one particular specimen and dives after him into the pool
leading away.

--"Don't let them escape, I need these specimens!"

...

After the battle Iosif is more likely to grant their request. He also asks to
investigate what happened to the tanks and who busted them open, releasing the
krasis.

...

Clues that they can find:

- Specific cracks in the glass, as if destroyed from outside with
a sharp tool.
- A pickaxe thrown into the breeding pool. It is fresh and seems to still
have a price label attached.
- A pair of humanoid tracks slowly drying out. They lead from one of the
water entryways (trough a basin) into this laboratory. Tracks leave hastily
through the door.

...

If they follow the pickaxe to the Tin Street, they can find the stall with
multiple identical pickaxes. The stall-keeper is a young human boy, Jaxon, around
16 years old. He is not very helpful, unless he is given a hefty sum, or
interrogated in other means.

Clues that can be given:

- A young woman came over today, and bought two pickaxes. She looked stunning,
with a dark long dress and pale skin. Her arms were quite long. She picked two
identical pickaxes and ordered her thrull to carry them. Then she paid in gold
and left.
- Large looking Rakdos Cultist bought a replacement for his pickaxe, he chose
one of the larger ones, almost ogre sized. He seemed to swing it easily.
- An Azorius Lawmage came through today, asked if there was any problems regarding
Rakdos or Gruul in the last few days, wrote down my statement and left.
- Most probably this pickaxe in particular was stolen when the boy was not looking.
He figures that out and asks to return the pickaxe. He points to other stalls,
maybe older merchants saw who stole a pickaxe.

# NPC Beggar Annabelle

Looking around they see an old woman who stares dead on at them. She is sitting
in the corner, with a small cup in front of her and a weird looking furry hat on
top of her head. She is a tad crazy and speaks in breaking voice. Sometimes
mumbles something out of the context.

- Poor boy, his father will scold him, for he lost three pickaxes only today.
- Yes, I saw, I see many things. Spirits talk to me, birds sing to me. Even stones
tell their stories.
- Why should I tell you anything? You are standing on my favourite stone!
- Ok, ok, Ana speaks. But give Annabelle some food! No, not the vile Golgari shit!
I want cherries!
- He was tall and Vedalken. His blue hand had a number written on it. 17.
