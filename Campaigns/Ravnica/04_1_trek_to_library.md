# Setup

The party goes out to resurrect one of their fallen friends. They ask about and
obtain the knowledge that a potion of resurrection can be made with the help of
Simic Biochemist.

They delve deep into Zonot Seven to find the Biochemist Iosif.

They are greeted by a large underwater basin next to breeding chambers, filled
with various species, collected from both underwater and above. Behind many
huge glass containers, there is a small corridor, which leads to a blackened
metal door.

--"What brings you to the exalted laboratory of Biochemist Iosif?"- a wrinkled
vedalken greets the party.

...

Suddenly great ruckus starts outside the door. If party investigates they are
attacked by released Simic experiments.

Specimen #74: [Flying] [Amorphous Structure]

  Flying blob of various colors, steadily shifting among the shapeless
  carapace. It appears to have some sort of skin, but no distinguishable
  appendages. A wurm like mouth is placed in front of the creature, no visible
  eyes.

Specimen #113: [Regeneration] [Stabilizing Legs]

  A five legged muscle patch, with a bird like beak menacing on a strong neck.
  Two eyes are placed on either side of the beak, forcing the head to tilt from
  side to side in order to see properly. Legs are boneless, slurping around but
  have sharp looking claws at the end of each.

Specimen #7: [Hypnotic Display] [Cryptic Skin]

  A rodent like creature, with bald chameleon skin and five skinny tails, has
  small lizard like head and drake like legs.

Specimen #67: [Armored Hide] [Leaping Legs]

  Frog and crab hibrid, with two strong claws, chitinous skin and muscular back
  legs. It's black bead eyes are standing on small antenna.

Specimen N-11: [Aquatic] [Heightened Awareness] [Bioluminescent Markings]

  A four legged shark like creature, with multiple eyes on flexible stems and a
  strong jaw. It's scales are covered in colorful markings which glow in the
  dark.

Iosif jumps through the door, gasps in anger, his all creations are running
amok. He notices one particular specimen and dives after him into the pool
leading away.

--"Don't let them escape, I need these specimens!"

...

After the battle Iosif is more likely to grant their request. He also asks to
investigate what happened to the tanks and who busted them open, releasing the
krasis.

...

Clues that they can find:

- Specific cracks in the glass, as if destroyed from outside with
a sharp tool.
- A pickaxe thrown into the breeding pool. It is fresh and seems to still
have a price label attached.
- A pair of humanoid tracks slowly drying out. They lead from one of the
water entryways (trough a basin) into this laboratory. Tracks leave hastily
through the door.
