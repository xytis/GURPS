## NPC Iosif

Vedalken, of really old age, his wrinkles are covering otherwise smooth face.
His hands are slightly trembling, but he shows unprecedented wisdom and
awareness. Sometimes even in the borderline of psychic powers.

# Setup

The party goes out to resurrect one of their fallen friends. They ask about
and obtain the knowledge that a potion of resurrection can be made with the
help of Simic alchemist.

They delve deep into Zonot Seven to find the Alchemist Iosif.

They are greeted by a large underwater basin next to breeding chambers, filled
with various species, collected from both underwater and above. Behind many
huge glass containers, there is a small corridor, which leads to a blackened
metal door.

--"What brings you to exalted laboratory of Alchemist Iosif?"- a wrinkled
vedalken greets the party.

...

Suddenly great ruckus starts outside the door. If party investigates they are
attacked by released Simic experiments.

...

After the battle Iosif is more likely to grant their request. He also asks to
investigate what happened to the tanks and who busted them open, releasing the
krasis.

...

Clues that they can find:

- Specific cracks in the glass, as if destroyed from outside with
a sharp tool.
- A pickaxe thrown into the breeding pool. It is fresh and seems to still
have a price label attached.
- A pair of humanoid tracks slowly drying out. They lead from one of the
water entryways (trough a basin) into this laboratory.

...

If they follow the pickaxe to the Tin Street, they can find the stall with
multiple identical pickaxes. The stall-keeper is a young human boy, around
16 years old. He is not very memorable, unless he is given a hefty sum, or
interrogated in other means.
