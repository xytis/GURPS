# Setup

Players are given the information (by any means) that there is a Healer in
Selesnya who can help them. His name is Wyn Zumro.

Players encounter a pack of goblins that have surrounded a Dire Wolf. A lone
ranger shoots an arrow to confront them.

There is a large half-ogre standing tall in front of the wolf. He shouts his
name:

--"Breegork take hide! Breegork kill wolf!"

--"Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!"- surrounding goblins chant.

When fight turns sour goblins will scramble. Breegork will shout:

--"Breegork not afraid! WRRAAARGHHHH!!!" and charge closest PC.
