# Setup

Players are given the information (by any means) that there is a Healer in
Selesnya who can help them. His name is Wyn Zumro.

Players encounter a pack of goblins that have surrounded a Dire Wolf. A lone
ranger shoots an arrow to confront them.

## NPC Wyn Zumro

Elf, slightly shorter than an average elf, with long black hair, tightly bound
into a bun behind his head. Only few straight strands of hair are falling on
his smooth elvish face. His eyes are showing age, but his composure is firm. He
is a bit naive and welcoming. He is caring for all living and sometimes even
the dead. His major flaw is his love for his niece Neia.
