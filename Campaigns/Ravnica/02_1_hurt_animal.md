# Setup

Players are given the information (by any means) that there is a Healer in
Selesnya who can help them. His name is Wyn Zumro.

Players encounter a pack of goblins that have surrounded a Dire Wolf. A lone
ranger shoots an arrow to confront them.

There is a large half-ogre standing tall in front of the wolf. He shouts his
name:

--"Breegork take hide! Breegork kill wolf!"

--"Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!"- surrounding goblins chant.

When fight turns sour goblins will scramble. Breegork will shout:

--"Breegork not afraid! WRRAAARGHHHH!!!" and charge closest PC.

Goblins:

Xoiskulb, smallest of the pack, with ears larger than average. Has few small animal tattoos and a spear.
Zak, his muscular arms carry a bow, he has a belt with at least five daggers on it.
Amizz, largest of them, has a small buckler and an axe. His bald head has a large scar going through top of the head.
Trux, short with a wide stance, uses a wooden mace with bone spikes, his tomahawk hair are trying to compensate for his height.

All carry the amulets of Gravel Hide Clan, which are made from few bones and a stone with a hole.
