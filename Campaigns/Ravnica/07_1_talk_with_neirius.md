# Neirius

Neirius sends the party to a nearby inn to have a pint on his tab, then joins
them after an hour or so.

--"Well, it was a long day today..."- he starts.

He aims to tell more about his experiment, which should revolutionise the way
mana dependant experiments are done. His current device is only a prototype,
but he thinks he can make it portable and useful for any spellcaster across
Ravnica, and maybe even beyond that. But there are still experiments to be
done, which are dangerous, and Neirius can pay 1 gold piece per person per day
for staying close to him during further trials.

Also for responding to his call for aid, he promises to pay for whatever drinks
they have plus a bonus of 25 gold pieces each for the problems they had
encountered until now.

--"My experiments will attract more and more attention, since I am going to
perform them outside the safety of my laboratory. I am very glad to have you by
my side for this."
