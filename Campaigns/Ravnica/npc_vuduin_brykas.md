# NPC: Vuduin Brykas

Vuduin is a humanoid, with pale skin and weirdly slim palms.  His head is
covered under white Selesnyan hood. Under the hood there is a slim long face
with black eyes.  His voice is soft and aluring, he always welcomes others to
talk with him.  He is well liked by children in Selesnya, as he always carries
some sweet edibles with him, his favourite beeing deim berries and sweetroot
sticks.

He is the leader of "The Gift of Life", he gives discarded simic experimentees
a will to live. He is treated highly among Selesnyan priesthood, but he never
aimed to get any title. His pupils and underlings simply call him "Mr. Brykas".
