Prologue
========

After the disappearance of the Ancients the southern lands of 'Archara stayed uninhabited for centuries before the first settlers migrated there.
Soon enough deserted cities came back to life. Deserters, wanderers and nomads found their new homes in the ruins of the mighty Ancients.

The City of Gord was the cradle of civilization and prosperity, which spread to nearby cities. Soon enough thirst for power arose among the most
wealthy and influential families of Gord. The first family to declare itself as leading line was House de Tier. By blood and gold they gained
their power in the city. During their reign of nearly two centuries they established the Kingdom of Gord, spread along the coast of Kiald.
From the Dragtuth mountains to the cold peaks of Frestur, with most notable the cities of Gord, 'Ardron and Hindar.

The Priest order of Auvae collected the remaining knowledge of the Ancients and controls the main religion in Kingdom. All this while being the most influential
force among lower castes they shy away from publicity. They successfully keep magic and deeper knowledge outside the law, which is dictated by them.

The last de Tier to climb the throne, Augrono De Tier, was a weak and shortsighted leader. He disregarded the local priesthood, disobeyed
sacred laws and thus created tension between the Auvae and the throne. This situation was quickly exploited by another family, the Del'rad. They started a
civil uprising, killing every last of the de Tier in the city of Gord. The last living offspring of Augrono -- brothers Antonio and Frocho have
avoided death and disappeared.
