#Obtaining the equipment

Party follows the Chief or Guard to the Armory.

-"Your equipment should be ready by now. Wait here, I'll find Timothy."

Chief disappears into the deeper rooms of armoury, shouting for Timothy. As you
look around you see saddles, leather armor hanging on the racks, bows near the
ceiling, quivers of arrows and bolts neatly stacked in racks near the walls.
Your eye is caught by an ornate scabbard of a fine broadsword. You hear the
semi-loud conversation of chief and Timothy slowly approaching the door.

As Timothy enters the room, he points to six backpacks by the wall:

-"Rations and basic equipment for two weeks of riding. Fill your waterskins by
the well before leaving."
