##Ramparts of Bardhof

As the party approached from the North a town of Bardhof layed in the valey.
Compared to the masonry of Fort Horth, this town had no protection whatsoever.
A wooden wall, that seemed more like a fence to keep the sheep in, wooden
lookout towers here and there, a single guard sitting in a shade next to the
entrance to the town. Nothing in this picture showed that the town is (or was)
in danger.

Guard gave directions to the central hall of Bardhof. Representative Marcos is
usualy there. If not, people there should know where he is.

Guard knows where to find a tavern. Guard recognises the soldiers from
Ironfire's Army and Blacksteel Insignia.

##Central Hall

Daytime the hall is occupied by representative Marcos, currently elected leader
of this town, and members of Great House.

Among the members you see a familiar face - Joilie, the tactician, who
apparently was tasked to keep this town in shape to provide supplies to
advancing army.

Marcos after hearing your intruduction directs you to Joilie and asks to keep
the town safe.

##Joile, the tactician

A young looking dark haired scribe. He is writing something as you approach.

-"Ah, yes, I was informed that you will arrive."

##Marcos, the representative

A strong man, dark haired with strands of gray already creeping onto his scalp.
He wears a simple robe and does not carry any visible weapons.
