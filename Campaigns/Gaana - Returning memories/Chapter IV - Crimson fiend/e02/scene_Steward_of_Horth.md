#Gates of Fort Horth

-"Halt! Who goes there!"

Party is greeted by the gate guards. Both undead hide their skulls under heavy
cloaks. After introduction, the guards direct the party straight to the keep,
as the steward is expecting their return.

Adventurers are quick to notice that the city is way less crowded. Soldiers,
which used to fill the streets, drink ale in the taverns and train in the
courtyard are gone. Only a handful of guards remained. Keep was still looking
strong and impenetrable and the shadowy corridors were just as unwelcoming as
always. Steward was siting in the main hall, next to a pile of papers and
books, performing his usual accounting.

-"Ah! Please tell me you brought me good news!"

After a short conversation the squad is tasked to march directly to Bardhof.

-"Report to representative Marcos. He will be giving further orders."
