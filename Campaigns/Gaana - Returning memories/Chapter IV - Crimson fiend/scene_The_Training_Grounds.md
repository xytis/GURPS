#Day before departure

_NPC_

Timmy, the silent: Young male, slighly tanned, dark haired, with brown eyes.
Has a distinguishing nose and is reluctant to speak. He is very cheerful and
chatty when drunk though.

_Player characters and Timmy are gathered on training grounds and are sparring
among each other. Ranged fighters (if any) are shooting at hay targets._

Light rain is falling from gray sky. The mood of the new recruits is grumpy, as
all of them would rather sit in a warm inn and enjoy some local brew instead of
getting beat up by trainer in a yard that during last few days became a large
pool of mud.

_Players are taken to turn by turn combat explanation_

During their second round war drums start beating. A messenger relays some
orders to the old trainer. He instructs all six characters (including Timmy) to
get some rest and return with raising Su prepared to travel north.
