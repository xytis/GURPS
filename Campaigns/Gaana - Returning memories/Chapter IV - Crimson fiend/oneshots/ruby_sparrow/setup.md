It is a well known fact that Lord Bartholomew Whytton has an magnificent
automaton in his possession: "The Ruby Sparrow". It is rumored that this
mechanimagical contraption was made by a genius artificer as a gift to his wife
just before her death. There is an urban legend that the Sparrow is able to
heal a broken heart after a loved one passes away.

In the dark alleys of Ironfire a rumour spread, that there is a person wishing
to acquire "The Ruby Sparrow". A band of unknown thieves took the job of
"transitioning" ownership to this interested party.

# Hooks ## Celebration of Hutia, Goddess Of Success

This year Whytton estate will become a four day celebration of Hutia, the
Goddess of Success. There are not many believers in Hutia, and most of them are
from upper class of Ironfire. These honorary guests have been invited to the
celebration:
 - Yvon Verne: the last and only pupil of Master Asmundsson, the creator of
    Ruby Sparrow. He is responsible for the pristine crystal glass cage where
    the automaton is held.
 - High Father Fan Yin: the highest ranking noble among the ranks of cult of
    Hutia. He came all the way to Ironfire to celebrate a long lasting trade
    agreement between his distant homeland Yatan and the nobles of Ironfire.
    ...

The celebration is orchestrated in 4 different stages:
 - Acquaintance
    Members are encouraged to talk and share their experiences, meet new faces
    and try to expand their social circles. Dominant color is white. By the
    commandments of Hutia if a person is wearing a white scarf, he must be
    approached and his name must be remembered. Usually new members are given
    the ceremonial white scarf and older members are approaching them.
 - Rivalry
    Members of the cult are invited to compete in the field of their choice. It
    can be any non-lethal competition, as all failure is part of the path to
    success, by the commandment of Hutia. Dominant color is green. People can
    give each other green parchments or other green items to challenge each
    other.
 - Pleasure
    Reward for any trial or success is pleasure. Either physical either mental.
    Festivals of Hutia are infamous because of this third day, as to external
    viewer this is a day of extreme debauchery. Members engage in all possible
    pleasures, including, but not limiting to sex and drugs. Dominant color is
    red. Members are encouraged to share red items or, especially women, give
    out red lipstick marks to any member which they find deserving of their
    company.
 - Amends
    Last day members are invited to give out their amends to anyone who helped
    them in the path of success. Members usually announce their donations or
    gifts to either outsiders or members of the same cult. Dominant color is
    yellow. Members usually express their gratitude in gold.
