It is a well known fact that Lord Bartholomew Whytton has an magnificent
automaton in his possession: "The Ruby Sparrow". It is rumored that this
mechanimagical contraption was made by a genius artificer as a gift to his wife
just before her death. There is an urban legend that the Sparrow is able to
heal a broken heart after a loved one passes away.

In the dark alleys of Ironfire a rumour spread, that there is a person wishing
to acquire "The Ruby Sparrow". A band of unknown thieves took the job of
"transitioning" ownership to this interested party.
