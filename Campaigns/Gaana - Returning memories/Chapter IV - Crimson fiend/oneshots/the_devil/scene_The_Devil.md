# The devil.

#### Chapter I

You arrived at outskirts Rivermeet late in the evening. The keep towers warmly
shimmered above the orchards. You were exhausted from a long trip and wanted to
find a decent place to sleep. You saw someone still walking between the
fruit-trees and asked the late bloke for directions to a nearest decent place
to stay for the night. He gave you a general direction to "Cross and Toad" and
walked away on his own business. Good thing the place he mentioned was hard to
miss. Well lit and in the main crossroad, "Cross and Toad" willingly invited
everyone to come in. Unfortunately you quickly were returned to reality by
fancy dressed host, which demanded 5 silver pieces only for a nights stay.
As you humbly asked if there is a place where you and your party could rest for
a more 'understandable' price, host looked down on you with contempt and
pointed south-west. He mentioned something about "shambles" and "chickens" and
requested that we leave at once, if we do not intend to eat or sleep at "Cross
and Toad". As you walked away into a maze of smaller buildings Un was setting
below the rooftops. You were met with an unmistakable stench of rotten meat.
You tried to calm yourself that this place is called Shambles because they sell
rotten chicken meat. Or maybe some other meat. And maybe not rotten. Dark
figures were moving in the shadows here and there. You lit your torches and
continued to search for a bed. Most of the buildings had their windows tightly
shut. You were not sure if the inhabitants were afraid of the dark, the stench,
or other inhabitants. You were not sure if there are any inhabitants, since it
was extremely quiet, even for this type of night. Finally you reached the river
bank. Un was beautifully setting in the distance, coloring the waters of
Swaymist river bright orange. This view helped you to calm down and turn around
to continue searching The Shambles for an inn. Soon enough you followed a path
which appeared to lead directly to the very center of this district. In a
little square, a lone building with lit windows stood. Your brief moment of
happiness was broken by a terrorizing scream from an alley just behind you.
Quickly turning around you catch a glimpse of a dark large creature quietly
leaping away from behind a stall and disappearing into thick darkness. As you
rush to the stall you find a heavily wounded young fella. His eyes are full of
terror and his lips are moving monotonically, yet making little sound.

-"...a..ae..."

-"...a..ae..."

You move your head closer...

-"...tra...ae..."

-"...tra...ae..."

-"...tra...ae..."

Your ear is at his shaking lips:

-"...treadare..."

-"...treadare..."

-"...treadare..."

-"...treadare..."

-"...treadare..."

#### Chapter II

You lift the wounded lad and rush to the lit building. As you kick the door open
you are met with irritated stares from the local customers.

-"Help him, he's dying!" - you exhale while catching your breath.

Your pledge of help for a moment hung in the air, without anyone reacting.

-"El, place him on a table. Ruck, go wake Isabella. Make haste both of you!"

A young girl was standing next to the bar and commanding locals around. She then
quickly took some cloth and water and rushed to bandage the bleeding fella.
For a brief moment the inn was in complete silence, only the sound of dripping
blood and heavy breathing filled the void. Soon enough one of the braver locals
stood up an approached you.

-"What business an outsider with a half-dead lad in his hands has in Shambles
at this hour?"

Local looked at you with an exposed distrust. His hand was resting on his
weapon.

  _An interaction with NPC takes place, while Ruck leads an elderly Isabella
  into the inn. Isabella with the help of Helena bandage the nameless injured
  yet both speak grimly regarding survival after such injuries. Lad is placed
  on one of the beds to rest. Depending on your answers you may be provided
  with a place to stay overnight. Neutral result - you have to pay for the
  stay, worst result - you get into a fight with the locals._

As you mention the name "Traedare" a silent gasp rolls across the inn.

-"Where did _you_ heard that word?" - an old man in leather jacket asks. - "It
has been a while since I heard that name. An old tale speaks of a devil which
lives in the depths of ancient tunnels that spread under this very town..."

-"Ol'Two Bolt, don't you scare my customers with your stories today. The boy
might have simply been attacked by Shamble Raiders or how those punks call
themselves these days..." - a firmly standing old woman said from the doorway
to the kitchen.

-"Martha, these are not just stories. And if it realy is Traedare, we are all
in danger. Remember you just this morning complained that someone stole your
chickens? Shambles don't steal from Shambles! So under this town there are
long severs that were built together with this town, I 'member high officers
from Archipelago..."

-"You mean Archmages?" - a young boy interupted

-"Yeah, Archimages..." - Two Bolts spat out - "... where was I ... Ah, they
once said that this town in built on ancient tunnel system that is even older
than Ancients tunnels. So one part of severs connect to these Undersevers as we
used to call them in my early days. Mages made multiple excavations down here,
I had participated in several of them as a guard, but one day something
went wrong and they sealed every exit and banned anyone from entering the lower
levels of Undersever. But I still remember days when Undersever was common
destination for adventurers and brave souls alike. Not many returned, but those
who did, brought ancient relics and magic gemstones back."

-"Why did people stop going to Undersevers?" - another young boy interupted

-"Have you heard about common sense?" - Helena interupted - "I doubt that
ancient relics from a shithole like that are worth as much as your lives!"

-"Watch your language, young lady!" - Martha scolded.

-"Sorry, Gran'ma" - Helena turned back to the injured boy she was caring after.

-"But if I were you, I would stay away from whatever done this. Traedare or
not" - she murmured.

-"If I were younger I would go there myself and ..."

Suddenly doors flung open again and a tall firmly built woman entered. She was
dressed in leather armor, covered by a dark cloak, broadsword's hilt was peeking
out from under it.

-"Where is he?!"

Helena gestured the woman to come over. Woman's name was Verona. She was the
leader of the local gang.

-"Who did this!?" - her stare flew across the room as everyone hid their eyes
in their ale. Few outsiders stared back at her openly and she lashed out on
them - "You there! Did you have anything to do with this?!" - she yelled as
she unsheated her broadsword.

-"Calm down Verona!" - a pale creature commanded from darkness of the wide
open door - "This outsider brought your son in. He was attacked by something
non human."

Verona froze for a moment. She knew not to mess with the witch which just came
in to the now silent inn. "Better ofter them some coin to go and investigate
the creature... And if you succeed in finding and killing it -- I will pay
a hefty price for it's remains." - the witch finished her sentence staring
directly into your eyes.
